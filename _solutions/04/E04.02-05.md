description: "V.

> V. Pan has discovered a way of multiplying $$68 \times 68$$ matrices using $$132, 464$$ multiplications, a way of multiplying $$70 \times 70$$ matrices using $$143, 640$$ multiplications, and a way of multiplying $$72 \times 72$$ matrices using $$155, 424$$ multiplications. Which method yields the best asymptotic running time when used in a divide-and-conquer matrix-multiplication algorithm? How does it compare to Strassen’s algorithm?

We can extend the calculations we have done in [previous exercise]({% link _solutions/04/E04.02-04.md %}) for $$m$$ sub-problems with $$k$$ multiplications as $$T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_m k})$$.

Hence, we need to find the minimum of the following:

$$
\log_{68} 132,464 = 2.795128 \\
\log_{70} 143,640 = 2.795122 \\
\log_{72} 155,424 = 2.795147
$$

Hence, the second method yields the best asymptotic running time when used in a divide-and-conquer matrix-multiplication algorithm.

This algorithm runs asymptotically faster than Strassen’s algorithm as $$\lg 7 > 2.8 > \log_{70} 143,640$$.

{% capture note %}
[Victor Yakovlevich Pan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Pan 'Victor Yakovlevich Pan'){:target='_blank'} discovered the method mentioned in this exercise in 1978, which was first improvement over Straseen's algorithm (published in 1969). His work kicked off a race for improving matrix multiplication speed that continues till today.

As of [January 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05846 'A Refined Laser Method and Faster Matrix Multiplication'){:target='_blank'}, the matrix multiplication algorithm with best asymptotic complexity runs in $$O(n^{2.3728596})$$ time.

And yes, that 7 digits after decimal is required, as before that the best asymptotic complexity was $$O(n^{2.3728639})$$, which was published in [2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.7714 'Powers of Tensors and Fast Matrix Multiplication'){:target='_blank'}.

So an improvement of $$0.0000043$$ in 6 years! Crazy!
