>Use the master method to give tight asymptotic bounds for the following recurrences.
>
>1. $$T(n) = 2T(n/4) + 1$$.
<br/>
2. $$T(n) = 2T(n/4) + \sqrt n$$.
<br/>
3. $$T(n) = 2T(n/4) + n$$.
<br/>
4. $$T(n) = 2T(n/4) + n^2$$.

In all of the recurrences, $$a = 2$$ and $$b = 4$$. Hence, $$n^{\log_b a} = n^{1/2}$$.

<b>Recurrence 1 :</b> $$f(n) = O(1) = O(n^{1/2 - 1/2}) \implies \text {case 1}$$
Hence, $$T(n) = \Theta(n^{1/2})$$

<b>Recurrence 2 :</b> $$f(n) = O(n^{1/2}) \implies \text {case 2}$$
Hence, $$T(n) = \Theta(n^{1/2} \lg n)$$

<b>Recurrence 3 :</b> $$f(n) = O(n) = O(n^{1/2 + 1/2}) \implies \text {case 3}$$
Hence, $$T(n) = \Theta(n)$$

<b>Recurrence 4 :</b> $$f(n) = O(n^2) = O(n^{1/2 + 3/2}) \implies \text {case 3}$$
Hence, $$T(n) = \Theta(n^2)$$
