> Illustrate the operation of $$\textsc{Max-Heap-Insert}(A, 10)$$ on the heap $$A = \langle 15, 13, 9, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 0, 6, 2, 1 \rangle$$.

The $$\textsc{Max-Heap-Insert}$$ operation adds a new element to the max-heap while maintaining the heap property. Think of it like adding a new high-priority task to a job scheduler. The new element starts at the bottom and "bubbles up" until it finds its proper position.

**Initial heap:**

$$A = \langle 15, 13, 9, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 0, 6, 2, 1 \rangle$$ with $$\text{heap-size} = 12$$

Tree representation:

```
         15
       /    \
      13     9
     / \    / \
    5  12  8   7
   /\  /\
  4 0 6  2 1
```

**Step 1:** Expand the heap by incrementing heap-size.

$$\text{heap-size} = 13$$

**Step 2:** Add a new leaf with key $$-\infty$$ (a sentinel value smaller than any actual key).

$$A[13] = -\infty$$

The array becomes: $$\langle 15, 13, 9, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 0, 6, 2, 1, -\infty \rangle$$

```
         15
       /    \
      13     9
     / \    / \
    5  12  8   7
   /\  /\  /
  4 0 6 2 1 -∞
```

**Step 3:** Call $$\textsc{Heap-Increase-Key}(A, 13, 10)$$ to set the key to 10.

The procedure sets $$A[13] = 10$$ and then bubbles it up.

$$A[13] = 10$$

```
         15
       /    \
      13     9
     / \    / \
    5  12  8   7
   /\  /\  /
  4 0 6 2 1 10
             i
```

Compare with parent: $$A[6] = 8 < A[13] = 10$$, so swap:

$$\langle 15, 13, 9, 5, 12, 10, 7, 4, 0, 6, 2, 1, 8 \rangle$$

```
         15
       /    \
      13     9
     / \    / \
    5  12  10  7
   /\  /\  /
  4 0 6 2 1 8
          i
```

Compare with parent: $$A[3] = 9 < A[6] = 10$$, so swap:

$$\langle 15, 13, 10, 5, 12, 9, 7, 4, 0, 6, 2, 1, 8 \rangle$$

```
         15
       /    \
      13     10
     / \    /  \
    5  12  9    7
   /\  /\  /
  4 0 6 2 1 8
       i
```

Compare with parent: $$A[1] = 15 > A[3] = 10$$, so the heap property is satisfied. Stop.

**Final result:**

$$A = \langle 15, 13, 10, 5, 12, 9, 7, 4, 0, 6, 2, 1, 8 \rangle$$

```
         15
       /    \
      13     10
     / \    /  \
    5  12  9    7
   /\  /\  /
  4 0 6 2 1 8
```

The new element (10) has found its correct position in the heap, maintaining the max-heap property that every parent is greater than or equal to its children. The operation runs in $$O(\lg n)$$ time because the element can bubble up at most the height of the tree.
