#### Base Case

When $$n = 2$$, $$T(2) = 2 = 2 \lg 2$$. So, the solution holds for the initial step.

#### Inductive Step

Let's assume that there exists a $$k$$, greater than 1, such that $$T(2^k) = 2^k \lg 2^k$$. We must prove that the formula holds for $$k + 1$$ too, i.e. $$T(2^{k + 1}) = 2^{k + 1} \lg 2^{k + 1}$$.

From our recurrence formula,

$$\begin{aligned}
T(2^{k + 1}) & = 2T(2^{k + 1}/2) + 2^{k + 1} \\
             & = 2T(2^k) + 2 \cdot 2^k \\
             & = 2 \cdot 2^k \lg 2^k + 2 \cdot 2^k \\
             & = 2 \cdot 2^k (\lg 2^k + 1) \\
             & = 2^{k + 1} (\lg 2^k + \lg 2) \\
             & = 2^{k + 1} \lg 2^{k + 1}
\end{aligned}$$

This completes the inductive step.

Since both the base case and the inductive step have been performed, by mathematical induction, the statement $$T(n) = n\lg n$$ holds for all $$n$$ that are exact power of 2.
