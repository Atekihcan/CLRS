> Demonstrate what happens when we insert the keys 5, 28, 19, 15, 20, 33, 12, 17, 10 into a hash table with collisions resolved by chaining. Let the table have 9 slots, and let the hash function be $$h(k) = k \bmod 9$$.

We have a hash table $$T$$ with $$m = 9$$ slots (indexed 0 through 8) and hash function $$h(k) = k \bmod 9$$. We'll insert the keys in order, showing the hash value for each and building the chained lists.

**Computing hash values:**

- $$h(5) = 5 \bmod 9 = 5$$
- $$h(28) = 28 \bmod 9 = 1$$
- $$h(19) = 19 \bmod 9 = 1$$
- $$h(15) = 15 \bmod 9 = 6$$
- $$h(20) = 20 \bmod 9 = 2$$
- $$h(33) = 33 \bmod 9 = 6$$
- $$h(12) = 12 \bmod 9 = 3$$
- $$h(17) = 17 \bmod 9 = 8$$
- $$h(10) = 10 \bmod 9 = 1$$

**Insertion sequence:**

Assuming we insert at the head of each list (the typical strategy for $$O(1)$$ insertion), the table evolves as follows:

After inserting **5**: `T[5] → 5`

After inserting **28**: `T[1] → 28`, `T[5] → 5`

After inserting **19**: `T[1] → 19 → 28`, `T[5] → 5`

After inserting **15**: `T[1] → 19 → 28`, `T[5] → 5`, `T[6] → 15`

After inserting **20**: `T[1] → 19 → 28`, `T[2] → 20`, `T[5] → 5`, `T[6] → 15`

After inserting **33**: `T[1] → 19 → 28`, `T[2] → 20`, `T[5] → 5`, `T[6] → 33 → 15`

After inserting **12**: `T[1] → 19 → 28`, `T[2] → 20`, `T[3] → 12`, `T[5] → 5`, `T[6] → 33 → 15`

After inserting **17**: `T[1] → 19 → 28`, `T[2] → 20`, `T[3] → 12`, `T[5] → 5`, `T[6] → 33 → 15`, `T[8] → 17`

After inserting **10**: `T[1] → 10 → 19 → 28`, `T[2] → 20`, `T[3] → 12`, `T[5] → 5`, `T[6] → 33 → 15`, `T[8] → 17`

**Final hash table:**

```
T[0]: NIL
T[1]: 10 → 19 → 28
T[2]: 20
T[3]: 12
T[4]: NIL
T[5]: 5
T[6]: 33 → 15
T[7]: NIL
T[8]: 17
```

Three slots (0, 4, 7) remain empty. Slots 1 and 6 each have chains of length 2 (collisions occurred), while slots 2, 3, 5, and 8 each have a single element.

The load factor is $$\alpha = n/m = 9/9 = 1$$, and we have 2 collisions (pairs that hash to the same slot): (28, 19), (28, 10), (19, 10) at slot 1, and (33, 15) at slot 6. Actually, we have 4 colliding pairs total: 3 pairs among {10, 19, 28} and 1 pair {33, 15}.

{% capture note %}
**Average Chain Length**

The load factor $$\alpha = 1$$ means we have as many keys as slots. From Theorem 11.2 in the textbook, the expected time for a successful search is $$\Theta(1 + \alpha) = \Theta(2)$$. In our example, the longest chain has length 3 (slot 1), which is slightly above average but not unusual for a random hash function with $$\alpha = 1$$.
