> Show that an $$n$$-element heap has height $$\lfloor \lg n \rfloor$$.

From [Exercise 6.1-1]({% link _solutions/06/E06.01-01.md %}), we know that a heap of height $$h$$ contains at least $$2^h$$ elements and at most $$2^{h+1} - 1$$ elements. This gives us the relationship:

$$2^h \le n \le 2^{h+1} - 1$$

Since $$2^{h+1} - 1 < 2^{h+1}$$, we can strengthen the right inequality to get:

$$2^h \le n < 2^{h+1}$$

Now we take logarithms (base 2) of all parts of the inequality:

$$\begin{align*}
\lg(2^h) &\le \lg n < \lg(2^{h+1}) \\
h &\le \lg n < h + 1
\end{align*}$$

This inequality tells us that $$\lg n$$ lies in the interval $$[h, h+1)$$. In other words, $$h$$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $$\lg n$$.

By definition, $$h = \lfloor \lg n \rfloor$$.
