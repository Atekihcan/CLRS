#### What sorcery is this?

As I have mentioned in the foreword, the goal of these solutions is not just providing the answer without engaging in the discussions required to understand the process.

I'll take few examples for now to explain how to find the tight bounds. For others, I'll revisit later or add based on comments.

Readers are encouraged to provide their own solutions as always.

##### A. $$\bm {f(n) = n - 1}$$

As $$c = 0$$, we are looking for _how many times_ $$f(n) = n - 1$$ has to be applied on $$n$$, to make $$f(n) \leq 0$$.

$$\begin{array}{cccc}
\textbf {Iteration} & \bm {f(n)} \\
\hline
1                   & n - 1      \\
2                   & n - 2      \\
3                   & n - 3      \\
\vdots              & \vdots     \\
n                   & n - n = 0  
\end{array}$$

So, $$f_c^*(n) = n$$, which is $$\Theta(n)$$.

___

##### B. $$\bm {f(n) = \lg n}$$

If you have read the section in the book where iterated logarithm functions is defined (page 58 in 3rd edition), you can see that this is exactly what was defined.

![Definition of iterated logarithm]({{ '/assets/img/03/3-6_iterated_functions.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }} "Definition of iterated logarithm")

Since, $$c = 1$$, $$f_c^*(n) = \lg^* n$$, which is $$\Theta(\lg^* n)$$.

##### CD. $$\bm {f(n) = n/2}$$

For $$c = 1$$, the number of times a number $$n$$ can be divided by 2, before it becomes less than or equal to 1 is $$\lg n$$.

And for $$c = 2$$, it'll be $$\lg n - 1$$.

Both of them are $$\Theta(\lg n)$$.

___

##### EF. $$\bm {f(n) = \sqrt n}$$

$$\begin{array}{cccc}
\textbf {Iteration} & \bm {f(n)} \\
\hline
1                   & n^{1/2}      \\
2                   & n^{1/4}      \\
3                   & n^{1/8}      \\
\vdots              & \vdots     \\
k                   & n^{1/2^k}  
\end{array}$$

For $$c = 2$$, we need to find $$k$$ for which $$n^{1/2^k} = 2$$.

$$\begin{aligned}
n^{1/2^k}           &= 2 \\
\lg (n^{1/2^k})     &= \lg 2 \\
\frac {\lg n} {2^k} &= 1
2^k                 &= \lg n \\
k                   &= \lg \lg n
\end{aligned}$$

So, $$f_c^*(n) = \lg \lg n$$, which is $$\Theta(\lg \lg n)$$.

However, for $$c = 1$$, there is no possible finite value of $$k$$ that can make $$n^{1/2^k} = 1$$. It is only possible when $$k \to \infty$$.
