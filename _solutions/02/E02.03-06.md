> Observe that the **while** loop of lines 5–7 of the $$\textsc {Insertion-Sort}$$ procedure in Section 2.1 uses a linear search to scan (backward) through the sorted sub-array $$A[1 . . j - 1]$$. Can we use a binary search (see [Exercise 2.3-5]({% link _solutions/02/E02.03-05.md %})) instead to improve the overall worst-case running time of insertion sort to $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$?

Let's take a look at the loop in question:

{% capture code %}
while i > 0 and A[i] > key
    A[i + 1] = A[i]
    i = i - 1
{% endcapture %}
{% include clrs_code.html offset=4 %}

This loop serves two purposes:

1. A linear search to scan (backward) through the sorted sub-array to find the proper position for $$key$$.
2. Shift the elements that are greater than $$key$$ towards the end to insert $$key$$ in the proper position.

Although we can reduce the number of comparisons by using binary search to accomplish purpose 1, we still need to shift all the elements greater than $$key$$ towards the end of the array to make space for $$key$$. And this shifting of elements runs at $$\Theta(n)$$ time, even in average case (as we need to shift half of the elements). So, the overall worst-case running time of insertion sort will still be $$\Theta(n^2)$$.
