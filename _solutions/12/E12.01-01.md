> For the set of $$\{1, 4, 5, 10, 16, 17, 21\}$$ of keys, draw binary search trees of heights 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

A binary search tree's height depends on the order of insertion or how we arrange the nodes. To create trees of different heights with the same keys, we can choose different roots and structure the tree accordingly.

**Height 2** (most balanced):

Choose the middle element (10) as root, then balance left and right subtrees. With 7 nodes, the minimum possible height is $$\lceil \lg 7 \rceil = 3$$, but we can achieve height 2 by careful arrangement:

```
        10
       /  \
      4    17
     / \   / \
    1   5 16 21
```

**Height 3**:

Choose a root slightly off-center, like 5:

```
       5
      / \
     4   16
    /    / \
   1   10  21
           /
         17
```

**Height 4**:

Make the tree more unbalanced by choosing 4 as root:

```
      4
     / \
    1   10
        / \
       5  17
           / \
         16  21
```

**Height 5**:

Create a chain-like structure:

```
     4
    / \
   1   5
        \
        10
          \
          16
            \
            17
              \
              21
```

**Height 6** (completely unbalanced, like a linked list):

```
  1
   \
    4
     \
      5
       \
       10
         \
         16
           \
           17
             \
             21
```

{% capture note %}
The worst-case height for $$n$$ nodes is $$n - 1$$ (a linear chain), while the best-case height is $$\lceil \lg(n+1) \rceil - 1$$ (a complete binary tree). For 7 nodes, heights range from 2 (complete tree) to 6 (linear chain). We cannot achieve height 0 or 1 with 7 nodes.
{% endcapture %}

The key insight is that the binary search tree property (left descendants $$\le$$ parent $$\le$$ right descendants) can be satisfied by many different tree structures for the same set of keys, resulting in vastly different heights and performance characteristics.
