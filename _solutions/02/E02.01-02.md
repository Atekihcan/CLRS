> Rewrite the $$\textsc {Insertion-Sort}$$ procedure to sort into non-increasing instead of non-decreasing order.

We just need to reverse the comparison of $$A[i]$$ and $$key$$ in line 5 as follows...

{% capture code %}
for j = 2 to A.length
    key = A[j]
    // Insert A[j] into the sorted sequence A[1 .. j-1]
    i = j - 1
    while i > 0 and A[i] < key
        A[i + 1] = A[i]
        i = i - 1
    A[i + 1] = key
{% endcapture %}
{% include clrs_code.html title='Insertion-Sort(A)' %}
