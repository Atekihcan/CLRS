> Argue that the solution to the recurrence $$T(n) = T(n/3) + T(2n/3) + cn$$, where c is a constant, is $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$ by appealing to a recursion tree.

The recurrence has two branches:

1. Growing at a rate of $$n/3$$
2. Growing at a rate of $$2n/3$$

The lower bound ($$\Omega$$) will be determined by the branch that terminates faster, as asymptotically the running time cannot be slower than that.

In this case, the branch of $$T(n/3)$$ will terminate, or reach leaf nodes, faster than the other one.

#### Recursion Tree for Ω

At depth $$i = 0, 1, 2, \dots, \log_3 n$$ of the tree, there are ***some*** nodes that costs a total of $$cn$$.

Hence, total cost of the tree is:

$$\begin {aligned}
T(n) & = \sum_{i = 0}^{\log_3 n} cn \\
     & = (\log_3 n + 1) cn \\
     & = cn \log_3 n + cn \\
     & = \frac{cn \log n}{\log 3} + cn\\
     & \ge cn \log n \\
     & = \Omega(n\log n)
\end {aligned}$$

The last step holds as long as $$cn \ge \log 3$$.

{% capture note %}
We actually don't. If you draw the recursion tree or refer refer figure 4.6 in the book, you'll see that in each completed levels of the tree, the cost of the nodes add up to $$cn$$. In level 0, there is only one node of cost $$cn$$. In level 1, there are one node of cost $$cn/3$$ and another of cost $$2cn/3$$. So on, and so forth.

And as we are interested only in the shortest branch of the recurrence tree in this problem, in all levels the tree will be complete.
