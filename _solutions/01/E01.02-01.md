> Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.

If you think about it, such examples are everywhere these days, much more than when CLRS was first published (1990). Here are few such examples...

##### File Explorer

Applies sorting algorithm whenever the user wants to sort the files according to the filenames or file type or date modified.

##### Netflix or Any streaming app

Applies a handful of [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_codec){:target="_blank"} to achieve video decoding and some for [recommending new content](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/100639){:target="_blank"}.

##### Any Game

Applies [clipping algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(computer_graphics)){:target="_blank"} to discard objects that are outside the viewport.
