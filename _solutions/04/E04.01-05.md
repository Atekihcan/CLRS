> Use the following ideas to develop a non-recursive, linear-time algorithm for the maximum-subarray problem. Start at the left end of the array, and progress toward the right, keeping track of the maximum subarray seen so far. Knowing a maximum subarray of $$A[1 \dots j]$$, extend the answer to find a maximum subarray ending at index $$j + 1$$ by using the following observation: a maximum subarray of $$A[1 \dots j + 1]$$ is either a maximum subarray of $$A[1 \dots j]$$ or a subarray $$A[i \dots j + 1]$$, for some $$1 \le i \le j + 1$$. Determine a maximum subarray of the form $$A[i \dots j + 1]$$ in constant time based on knowing a maximum subarray ending at index $$j$$.

The idea is to determine whether $$A[j + 1]$$ will be part of the maximum subarray of $$A[1 \dots j + 1]$$ or not. If it is a part of the maximum subarray, then we will update our maximum subarray to include $$A[j + 1]$$, otherwise we will maintain a temporary sum including $$A[j + 1]$$ in case we encounter a sufficiently large element later which can make the future sum greater than the present sum.

In other words, maintain two sum: a maximum subarray ending at current element, and maximum subarray so far.

{% capture code %}
best = -∞
current = 0
left = 0
right = 0
currentLeft = 0
for i = low to high
    current = current + A[i]
    if current > best
        best = current
        left = currentLeft
        right = i
    if current < 0
        current = 0
        currentLeft = i + 1
return (left, right, best)
{% endcapture %}
{%include clrs_code.html title="Find-Maximum-Subarray-Linear(A, low, high)" %}

In line 7, we update our current sum involving current element. And in lines 8-11, we update our best subarray, if required. In lines 12-14, we reset current running sum if it is negative.

A python implementation of this pseudocode is available at the [bottom of the page](#code-editor).

#### Runtime Comparison

We can measure the performance of this algorithm along with others as described in [Exercise 4.1.3]({% link _solutions/04/E04.01-03.md %}). As expected the linear algorithm runs much much faster than other algorithms (running times are in microseconds):

| Size | BruteForce | Recursive | Linear |
|:----:|:----------:|:---------:|:------:|
|  20  |   1.1168   |  1.2608   | 0.2176 |
|  21  |   1.1319   |  1.3312   | 0.2278 |
|  22  |   1.2343   |  1.3643   | 0.2445 |
|  23  |   1.3397   |  1.4459   | 0.2512 |
|  24  |   1.4235   |  1.5344   | 0.2537 |
|  25  |   1.5350   |  1.6118   | 0.2664 |
|  26  |   1.6584   |  1.6801   | 0.2766 |
|  27  |   1.7502   |  1.7495   | 0.2921 |
|  28  |   1.8662   |  1.8276   | 0.3040 |
|  29  |   1.9923   |  1.8878   | 0.3043 |
|  30  |   2.1180   |  1.9716   | 0.3153 |
|  31  |   2.2915   |  2.0271   | 0.3507 |

The C++ implementation to generate this data can be downloaded from [here]({{ '/assets/code/E415.cpp' | prepend: site.baseurl }} 'C++ Implementation to Compare Brute Force, Recursive, and Linear Running Times'){:target='_blank'}.

And here is a visual representation of the runtime comparison.

![Maximum Subarray Runtime Comparison]({{ '/assets/img/04/4.1-5_maxsubarray_runtime_comparison.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }} 'Maximum Subarray Runtime Comparison')

As you can see the brute force run time, $$\Theta(n^2)$$, very closely resembles a quadratic curve. Runtime of recursive method is $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$  and for linear it is $$\Theta(n)$$, the difference between them also can be seen clearly, although both resembles linear curve. That ambiguity will reduce if we can create graph for much higher input size, e.g. $$n = 1000$$.
