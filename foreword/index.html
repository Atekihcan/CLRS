<p>This <a href="https://atekihcan.github.io/CLRS/">website</a> contains my takes on the solutions for exercises and problems for the <strong>third edition</strong> of <strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2NhErxH">Introduction to Algorithms</a></em></strong> authored by <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/">Thomas H. Cormen</a>, <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/cel/">Charles E. Leiserson</a>, <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/">Ronald L. Rivest</a>, and <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~cs2035/">Clifford Stein</a>, commonly known as <strong><em>CLRS</em></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>If you are looking for complete solution for the book. This is not the place to be. As of March 2021, I have barely compiled solutions for first four chapters and one appendix.</em></p>

<p>I have included a list of other online resources which you can refer if you are looking for solutions to some chapters that I don’t have.</p>

<h2 id="some-backstory">Some Backstory</h2>

<p>Back in 2008-09, during my university years, I did not have much of a background in programming and Computer Science was a completely new concept. CLRS was the main textbook for two different courses that I had to <strong>suffer</strong> through. Red-Black trees in particular gave me nightmares.</p>

<p>Lot of things changed By 2015. I’ve been working as a software developer for 3 years by then. Hands-on experience in coding and debugging helped me in understanding the beautiful intricacies of data structures and algorithms. And I  started revisiting CLRS to understand DSA from a practical point of view.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Around the same time, I thought of compiling solutions to exercises and problems in a website to help others. And the main motivation was to explain the solutions in a way that I wish someone did for me when I was in college.</p>

<p>That means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Building intuition is more important than working out the mathematics</li>
  <li>Not trying to “finishing the syllabus” by just providing the answer</li>
  <li>Not assuming every reader is a genius CS prodigy</li>
  <li>Providing practical example or working code whenever possible</li>
  <li>Explaining the logical thought process on how to reach the solution</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <h3 id="2020-edit"><strong><em>2020 Edit</em></strong></h3>

  <p><em>As of 2020, I also plan to use this website for some selfish reasons:</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Experiment with latest web development/deployment related technologies.</li>
    <li>For example, in 2015 I developed this website with Bootstrap/jQuery and GitHub pages. Now it has been moved to pure Jekyll based static website without using any heavy framework. It is deployed using GitHub actions.</li>
    <li>Learn more about project management and deployment workflows using GitHub.</li>
    <li>Learn more about web analytics using Google Analytics.</li>
    <li>And finally use Adsense to generate some revenue from whatever traffic I receive.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="completeness-of-the-solutions">Completeness of the solutions</h2>

<p>As mentioned earlier, this website do not have complete solution for the book. Due to my day job and many other  commitments, I had stopped working on this after 2016. Recently during COVID lock-down, I have revived my interest in maintaining this work.</p>

<p>However, there is no plan to provide complete solution. I will stick to my motivation for doing this, and add solutions whenever I can.</p>

<p>There are many other online resources that has near complete solutions. Some of these are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~ajl213/CLRS/CLRS.html">Solutions by Andrew Lohr and Michelle Bodnar</a> : Closest to complete</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gzc/CLRS">GitHub repo managed by Zhenchao Gan</a> : Crowd-sourced, almost complete, with working codes</li>
  <li><a href="https://walkccc.me/CLRS/">Solutions by Jay Chen</a> : Crowd-sourced, almost complete</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.slader.com/textbook/9780262033848-introduction-to-algorithms-3rd-edition/">Solutions on Slader</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ita.skanev.com/">Solutions by Stefan Kanev</a> : Up to chapter 13</li>
</ul>

<p>You can probably follow any of these if you are looking for the solutions.</p>

<p>In fact I myself follow most of these when I’m stuck on some problem or want to verify the correctness of my solution.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-contribute">How to contribute</h2>

<p>You are welcome to leave comments on the particular solutions pages if you found any error or have a suggestion for better solution.</p>

<p>Also if you want to clone and create PR for new solutions, I’d be happy to merge the changes provided the explanations are inline with my <a href="#motivation">motivation</a>.</p>
