# Welcome

This [website](https://atekihcan.github.io/CLRS/) contains my takes on the solutions for exercises and problems for the **third edition** of ***[Introduction to Algorithms](https://amzn.to/2NhErxH)*** authored by [Thomas H. Cormen](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/), [Charles E. Leiserson](https://people.csail.mit.edu/cel/), [Ronald L. Rivest](http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/), and [Clifford Stein](http://www.columbia.edu/~cs2035/), commonly known as ***CLRS***.

**Note:** *If you are looking for complete solution for the book. This is not the place to be. As of March 2021, I have barely compiled solutions for first four chapters and one appendix.*

I have included a list of other online resources which you can refer if you are looking for solutions to some chapters that I don't have.

## Some Backstory

Back in 2008-09, during my university years, I did not have much of a background in programming and Computer Science was a completely new concept. CLRS was the main textbook for two different courses that I had to **suffer** through. Red-Black trees in particular gave me nightmares.

Lot of things changed By 2015. I've been working as a software developer for 3 years by then. Hands-on experience in coding and debugging helped me in understanding the beautiful intricacies of data structures and algorithms. And I  started revisiting CLRS to understand DSA from a practical point of view.

## Motivation

Around the same time, I thought of compiling solutions to exercises and problems in a website to help others. And the main motivation was to explain the solutions in a way that I wish someone did for me when I was in college.

That means:

* Building intuition is more important than working out the mathematics
* Not trying to "finishing the syllabus" by just providing the answer
* Not assuming every reader is a genius CS prodigy
* Providing practical example or working code whenever possible
* Explaining the logical thought process on how to reach the solution

> ### ***2020 Edit***
>
> *As of 2020, I also plan to use this website for some selfish reasons:*
>
> * Experiment with latest web development/deployment related technologies.
> * For example, in 2015 I developed this website with Bootstrap/jQuery and GitHub pages. Now it has been moved to pure Jekyll based static website without using any heavy framework. It is deployed using GitHub actions.
> * Learn more about project management and deployment workflows using GitHub.
> * Learn more about web analytics using Google Analytics.
> * And finally use Adsense to generate some revenue from whatever traffic I receive.

## Completeness of the solutions

As mentioned earlier, this website do not have complete solution for the book. Due to my day job and many other  commitments, I had stopped working on this after 2016. Recently during COVID lock-down, I have revived my interest in maintaining this work.

However, there is no plan to provide complete solution. I will stick to my motivation for doing this, and add solutions whenever I can.

There are many other online resources that has near complete solutions. Some of these are:

* [Solutions by Andrew Lohr and Michelle Bodnar](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~ajl213/CLRS/CLRS.html) : Closest to complete
* [GitHub repo managed by Zhenchao Gan](https://github.com/gzc/CLRS) : Crowd-sourced, almost complete, with working codes
* [Solutions by Jay Chen](https://walkccc.me/CLRS/) : Crowd-sourced, almost complete
* [Solutions on Slader](https://www.slader.com/textbook/9780262033848-introduction-to-algorithms-3rd-edition/)
* [Solutions by Stefan Kanev](https://ita.skanev.com/) : Up to chapter 13

You can probably follow any of these if you are looking for the solutions.

In fact I myself follow most of these when I'm stuck on some problem or want to verify the correctness of my solution.

## How to contribute

You are welcome to leave comments on the particular solutions pages if you found any error or have a suggestion for better solution.

Also if you want to clone and create PR for new solutions, I'd be happy to merge the changes provided the explanations are inline with my [motivation](#motivation).
