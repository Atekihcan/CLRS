> Show that if a node in a binary search tree has two children, then its successor has no left child and its predecessor has no right child.

We will prove both statements about successor and predecessor separately.

### Successor has no left child

**Claim:** If node $$x$$ has two children, then $$\textsc{Tree-Successor}(x)$$ has no left child.

**Proof:** Since $$x$$ has two children, it has a non-empty right subtree. By the definition of $$\textsc{Tree-Successor}$$, when $$x$$ has a right child, the successor is the minimum element in $$x$$'s right subtree:

$$y = \textsc{Tree-Minimum}(x.\textit{right})$$

The procedure $$\textsc{Tree-Minimum}$$ follows left child pointers until it reaches a node with no left child. Therefore, $$y$$ (the successor of $$x$$) has $$y.\textit{left} = \textsc{Nil}$$.

To see why this makes sense, suppose (for contradiction) that $$y$$ had a left child $$z$$. Then by the BST property, $$z.\textit{key} < y.\textit{key}$$. But $$y$$ is supposed to be the minimum in $$x$$'s right subtree, contradicting the existence of a smaller element $$z$$ in that subtree.

### Predecessor has no right child

**Claim:** If node $$x$$ has two children, then $$\textsc{Tree-Predecessor}(x)$$ has no right child.

**Proof:** By symmetry, since $$x$$ has two children, it has a non-empty left subtree. The predecessor is the maximum element in $$x$$'s left subtree:

$$y = \textsc{Tree-Maximum}(x.\textit{left})$$

The procedure $$\textsc{Tree-Maximum}$$ follows right child pointers until it reaches a node with no right child. Therefore, $$y$$ (the predecessor of $$x$$) has $$y.\textit{right} = \textsc{Nil}$$.

Again, if $$y$$ had a right child $$z$$, then $$z.\textit{key} > y.\textit{key}$$, contradicting the fact that $$y$$ is the maximum in $$x$$'s left subtree.

### Example

Consider this tree:

```
        15
       /  \
      6   18
     / \  / \
    3   7 17 20
   / \   \
  2   4  13
         /
        9
```

Node 15 has two children (6 and 18).

**Successor of 15:** The minimum in the right subtree of 15 is node 17. Node 17 has no left child ✓

**Predecessor of 15:** The maximum in the left subtree of 15 is node 13. Node 13 has no right child ✓

{% capture note %}
This property is crucial for the $$\textsc{Tree-Delete}$$ operation. When deleting a node $$z$$ with two children, we replace it with its successor $$y$$. The fact that $$y$$ has no left child (as proven above) simplifies the deletion: we can easily splice $$y$$ out of its current position by replacing it with its right child (which may be $$\textsc{Nil}$$).

If the successor had a left child, the deletion operation would be more complicated, potentially requiring recursive deletion.
