> Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.

#### Strengths of Linked List

1. Simpler addition and removal of elements, $$O(1)$$ time complexity
2. Does not need contiguous memory space
3. New element can be easily inserted in any location

#### Limitations of Linked List

1. Accessing an element by index or by value means traversing the list, $$O(n)$$ time complexity
2. Additional memory is required for storing the address (pointer) of the next/previous element.

#### Strengths of Array

1. Accessing any element by index is simple, $$O(1)$$ time complexity
2. No additional memory required to store address

#### Limitations of Array

1. Addition or removal of elements from any index but the last means re-arranging the whole list, $$O(n)$$ time complexity
2. Accessing an element by value means traversing the list, $$O(n)$$ time complexity
3. Needs contiguous memory
