> Show that the function $$f(x) = 2^x$$ is convex.

A function $$f$$ is **convex** if for all $$x, y$$ and all $$\lambda \in [0, 1]$$:

$$f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda) y) \le \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda) f(y)$$

Alternatively, a twice-differentiable function $$f$$ is convex if and only if its second derivative $$f''(x) \ge 0$$ for all $$x$$. We'll use this second method.

### Proof Using Second Derivative

For $$f(x) = 2^x$$:

**First derivative:**

$$\begin{align*}
f'(x) &= \frac{d}{dx}(2^x) \\
&= 2^x \ln 2
\end{align*}$$

**Second derivative:**

$$\begin{align*}
f''(x) &= \frac{d}{dx}(2^x \ln 2) \\
&= 2^x (\ln 2)^2
\end{align*}$$

Since $$2^x > 0$$ for all $$x$$ and $$(\ln 2)^2 > 0$$, we have:

$$f''(x) = 2^x (\ln 2)^2 > 0 \quad \text{for all } x$$

Therefore, $$f(x) = 2^x$$ is strictly convex ✓

### Alternative Proof Using Definition

We can also prove this directly from the definition of convexity. For any $$x, y \in \mathbb{R}$$ and $$\lambda \in [0, 1]$$:

$$\begin{align*}
f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda) y) &= 2^{\lambda x + (1-\lambda) y} \\
&= 2^{\lambda x} \cdot 2^{(1-\lambda) y} \\
&= (2^x)^\lambda \cdot (2^y)^{1-\lambda}
\end{align*}$$

By the **weighted AM-GM inequality** (arithmetic mean $$\ge$$ geometric mean):

$$\begin{align*}
(2^x)^\lambda \cdot (2^y)^{1-\lambda} &\le \lambda \cdot 2^x + (1-\lambda) \cdot 2^y \\
&= \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda) f(y)
\end{align*}$$

Therefore:

$$f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda) y) \le \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda) f(y)$$

This proves convexity ✓

### Why This Matters for Theorem 12.4

In the proof of Theorem 12.4, we use Jensen's inequality, which states that for a convex function $$f$$ and a random variable $$X$$:

$$f(\mathbb{E}[X]) \le \mathbb{E}[f(X)]$$

With $$f(x) = 2^x$$, this gives:

$$2^{\mathbb{E}[X_n]} \le \mathbb{E}[2^{X_n}]$$

where $$X_n$$ is the height of a randomly built binary search tree on $$n$$ nodes.

Rearranging:

$$\mathbb{E}[X_n] \le \log_2(\mathbb{E}[2^{X_n}]) = \log_2(\mathbb{E}[Y_n])$$

where $$Y_n = 2^{X_n}$$ is the exponential height.

This inequality is crucial for bounding the expected height in terms of the expected exponential height.

### General Exponential Functions

More generally, for any $$a > 0$$, the function $$f(x) = a^x$$ is convex. The proof is identical:

$$f''(x) = a^x (\ln a)^2 > 0 \quad \text{for all } x$$

So all exponential functions with base $$a > 1$$ are strictly convex.

{% capture note %}
Convexity of exponential functions is a fundamental property used throughout mathematics:

1. **Information theory:** Convexity of $$2^x$$ relates to entropy bounds
2. **Probability theory:** Jensen's inequality for exponential functions gives tail bounds
3. **Algorithm analysis:** Used to relate expected values of heights to expected exponential heights (as in Theorem 12.4)

The intuition: exponential functions "curve upward," so the secant line (connecting two points) lies above the function itself. This is the geometric interpretation of convexity.
