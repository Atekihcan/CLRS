> Using Figure 8.4 as a model, illustrate the operation of $$\textsc{Bucket-Sort}$$ on the array $$A = \langle .79, .13, .16, .64, .39, .20, .89, .53, .71, .42 \rangle$$.

We have $$n = 10$$ elements, so we create 10 buckets indexed from 0 to 9. Each element goes into bucket $$\lfloor n \cdot A[i] \rfloor = \lfloor 10 \cdot A[i] \rfloor$$.

**Step 1: Distribute elements into buckets**

For each element, calculate its bucket index:
- $$A[1] = .79 \rightarrow$$ bucket $$\lfloor 10 \times .79 \rfloor = 7$$
- $$A[2] = .13 \rightarrow$$ bucket $$\lfloor 10 \times .13 \rfloor = 1$$
- $$A[3] = .16 \rightarrow$$ bucket $$\lfloor 10 \times .16 \rfloor = 1$$
- $$A[4] = .64 \rightarrow$$ bucket $$\lfloor 10 \times .64 \rfloor = 6$$
- $$A[5] = .39 \rightarrow$$ bucket $$\lfloor 10 \times .39 \rfloor = 3$$
- $$A[6] = .20 \rightarrow$$ bucket $$\lfloor 10 \times .20 \rfloor = 2$$
- $$A[7] = .89 \rightarrow$$ bucket $$\lfloor 10 \times .89 \rfloor = 8$$
- $$A[8] = .53 \rightarrow$$ bucket $$\lfloor 10 \times .53 \rfloor = 5$$
- $$A[9] = .71 \rightarrow$$ bucket $$\lfloor 10 \times .71 \rfloor = 7$$
- $$A[10] = .42 \rightarrow$$ bucket $$\lfloor 10 \times .42 \rfloor = 4$$

**Buckets after distribution:**
- $$B[0]$$: empty
- $$B[1]$$: .13, .16
- $$B[2]$$: .20
- $$B[3]$$: .39
- $$B[4]$$: .42
- $$B[5]$$: .53
- $$B[6]$$: .64
- $$B[7]$$: .79, .71
- $$B[8]$$: .89
- $$B[9]$$: empty

**Step 2: Sort each bucket using insertion sort**

- $$B[1]$$: .13, .16 (already sorted)
- $$B[7]$$: .79, .71 $$\rightarrow$$ .71, .79

**Step 3: Concatenate buckets in order**

$$
[.13, .16, .20, .39, .42, .53, .64, .71, .79, .89]
$$

The array is now sorted! Notice how most buckets contain 0 or 1 element, making the insertion sort step trivial. This is typical when the input is uniformly distributed.
