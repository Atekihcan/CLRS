> Suppose we use $$\textsc{Randomized-Select}$$ to select the minimum element of the array $$A = (3, 2, 9, 0, 7, 5, 4, 8, 6, 1)$$. Describe a sequence of partitions that results in a worst-case performance of $$\textsc{Randomized-Select}$$.

The worst-case performance occurs when we consistently choose the worst possible pivot at each step. Since we are looking for the minimum ($$i = 1$$), the worst case happens when we always select the maximum element of the current subarray as the pivot, forcing us to recurse on a subarray that is only one element smaller.

Starting with $$A = (3, 2, 9, 0, 7, 5, 4, 8, 6, 1)$$, here is a worst-case sequence:

**Partition 1:** Choose 9 as pivot.
After partitioning: $$(3, 2, 0, 1, 5, 4, 8, 6, 7, 9)$$ (9 goes to position 10)
Since $$i = 1 < k = 10$$, recurse on the left 9 elements.

**Partition 2:** Choose 8 as pivot from $$(3, 2, 0, 1, 5, 4, 7, 6, 8)$$.
After partitioning: $$(3, 2, 0, 1, 5, 4, 7, 6, 8)$$ (8 goes to position 9)
Since $$i = 1 < k = 9$$, recurse on the left 8 elements.

**Partition 3:** Choose 7 as pivot from $$(3, 2, 0, 1, 5, 4, 6, 7)$$.
After partitioning: $$(3, 2, 0, 1, 5, 4, 6, 7)$$ (7 goes to position 8)
Since $$i = 1 < k = 8$$, recurse on the left 7 elements.

**Partition 4:** Choose 6 as pivot from $$(3, 2, 0, 1, 5, 4, 6)$$.
After partitioning: $$(3, 2, 0, 1, 5, 4, 6)$$ (6 goes to position 7)
Since $$i = 1 < k = 7$$, recurse on the left 6 elements.

**Partition 5:** Choose 5 as pivot from $$(3, 2, 0, 1, 4, 5)$$.
After partitioning: $$(3, 2, 0, 1, 4, 5)$$ (5 goes to position 6)
Since $$i = 1 < k = 6$$, recurse on the left 5 elements.

**Partition 6:** Choose 4 as pivot from $$(3, 2, 0, 1, 4)$$.
After partitioning: $$(3, 2, 0, 1, 4)$$ (4 goes to position 5)
Since $$i = 1 < k = 5$$, recurse on the left 4 elements.

**Partition 7:** Choose 3 as pivot from $$(3, 2, 0, 1)$$.
After partitioning: $$(2, 0, 1, 3)$$ (3 goes to position 4)
Since $$i = 1 < k = 4$$, recurse on the left 3 elements.

**Partition 8:** Choose 2 as pivot from $$(2, 0, 1)$$.
After partitioning: $$(0, 1, 2)$$ (2 goes to position 3)
Since $$i = 1 < k = 3$$, recurse on the left 2 elements.

**Partition 9:** Choose 1 as pivot from $$(0, 1)$$.
After partitioning: $$(0, 1)$$ (1 goes to position 2)
Since $$i = 1 < k = 2$$, recurse on the left 1 element.

**Base case:** Only element 0 remains, return it.

This sequence requires $$\Theta(n^2)$$ time, with the recursion depth being $$n - 1 = 9$$ and the total work being $$10 + 9 + 8 + \cdots + 2 = 54$$ partitioning operations.
