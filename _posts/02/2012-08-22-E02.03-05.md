> Referring back to the searching problem (see [Exercise 2.1-3]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /02/2012-08-22-E02.01-03 %})), observe that if the sequence $$A$$ is sorted, we can check the midpoint of the sequence against $$v$$ and eliminate half of the sequence from further consideration. The ***binary search*** algorithm repeats this procedure, halving the size of the remaining portion of the sequence each time. Write pseudocode, either iterative or recursive, for binary search. Argue that the worst-case running time of binary search is $$\Theta(\lg n)$$.

Here is the pseudocode if you prefer iterative solutions ...

{% capture code %}
low = A[1]
high = A[A.length]
while low <= high
    mid = floor( (low + high) / 2 )
    if v == A[mid]
        return mid
    elseif v > A[mid]
        low = mid + 1
    else
        high = mid - 1
return NIL
{% endcapture %}
{% include clrs_code.html title="Iterative-Binary-Search(A, v)" %}

And here is the recursive one ...

{% capture code %}
if low > high
    return NIL
mid = floor( (low + high) / 2 )
if v == A[mid]
    return mid
elseif v > A[mid]
    Recursive-Binary-Search(A, v, mid + 1, high)
else
    Recursive-Binary-Search(A, v, low, mid - 1)
{% endcapture %}
{% include clrs_code.html title="Recursive-Binary-Search(A, v, low, high)" %}

Intuitively, in worst case, i.e. when $$v$$ is not at all present in $$A$$, we need to search over the whole array to return $$\text {NIL}$$. In other words, we need to repeatedly divide the array by 2 and check either half for $$v$$. So the running time is nothing but how many times the input size can be divided by 2, i.e. $$\lg n$$.

For recursive case, we can write the recurrence as follows ...

$$T(n) = \begin {cases}
    \Theta(1)                   & \text { if } n = 1, \\
    T((n - 1)/2) + \Theta(1)    & \text { if } n > 1
\end {cases}$$
