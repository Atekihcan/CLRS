> Prove equation (12.3).

We need to prove the following combinatorial identity:

$$\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \binom{i+3}{3} = \binom{n+3}{4}$$

We will prove this by induction on $$n$$.

### Base Case

For $$n = 0$$:

**Left side:** The sum from $$i = 0$$ to $$i = -1$$ is empty, so the sum equals 0.

**Right side:** $$\binom{0+3}{4} = \binom{3}{4} = 0$$ (since we cannot choose 4 items from 3).

The base case holds: $$0 = 0$$ ✓

###Inductive Step

**Inductive hypothesis:** Assume the identity holds for $$n = k$$:

$$\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \binom{i+3}{3} = \binom{k+3}{4}$$

**Inductive step:** We need to show it holds for $$n = k + 1$$:

$$\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=0}^{k} \binom{i+3}{3} &= \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \binom{i+3}{3} + \binom{k+3}{3} \\
&= \binom{k+3}{4} + \binom{k+3}{3} \quad \text{(by inductive hypothesis)} \\
&= \binom{k+4}{4} \quad \text{(by Pascal's identity)}
\end{align*}$$

This is exactly $$\binom{(k+1)+3}{4}$$, completing the induction ✓

### Pascal's Identity

The key step uses Pascal's identity:

$$\binom{n}{k} + \binom{n}{k+1} = \binom{n+1}{k+1}$$

In our case, with $$n = k+3$$ and $$k = 3$$:

$$\binom{k+3}{3} + \binom{k+3}{4} = \binom{k+4}{4}$$

### Alternative Proof: Combinatorial Argument

We can also prove this identity combinatorially. Both sides count the number of ways to choose 4 objects from $$n+3$$ objects.

**Right side:** $$\binom{n+3}{4}$$ directly counts this.

**Left side:** We can partition these choices based on the position of the 4th largest element:
- If the 4th largest element is in position $$i+4$$ (where $$i = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1$$), then the three smaller elements must come from the first $$i+3$$ positions
- There are $$\binom{i+3}{3}$$ ways to choose these three elements

Summing over all possible positions of the 4th element gives:

$$\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \binom{i+3}{3}$$

Since both sides count the same thing, they must be equal ✓

{% capture note %}
This identity is a special case of the **hockey stick identity**:

$$\sum_{i=0}^{n} \binom{i+k}{k} = \binom{n+k+1}{k+1}$$

Our identity has $$k = 3$$ and the sum goes to $$n-1$$ instead of $$n$$, but it is the same pattern.

The hockey stick identity gets its name from its appearance in Pascal's triangle: if you sum along a diagonal, you get the next entry down and to the right.
