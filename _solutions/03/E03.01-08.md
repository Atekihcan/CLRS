> $$\begin {aligned}
O(g(n, m)) = \{ f(n , m) \text { : } & \text {there exist positive constants } c, n_0, \text { and } m_0 \\
& \text { such that } 0 \le f (n, m) \le cg(n, m) \\

> Give corresponding definitions for $$\Omega(g(n, m))$$ and $$\Theta(g(n, m))$$.

$$\Omega(g(n, m))$$ and $$\Theta(g(n, m))$$ can be defined as follows:

$$\begin {aligned}
\Omega(g(n, m)) = \{ f(n , m) \text { : } & \text {there exist positive constants } c, n_0, \text { and } m_0 \\
& \text { such that } 0 \le cg(n, m) \le f (n, m) \\
& \text { for all } n \ge n_0 \text { or } m \ge m_0\}
\end {aligned}$$

$$\begin {aligned}
\Theta(g(n, m)) = \{ f(n , m) \text { : } & \text {there exist positive constants } c_1, c_2, n_0, \text { and } m_0 \\
& \text { such that } 0 \le c_1g(n, m) \le f (n, m) \le c_2g(n, m) \\
& \text { for all } n \ge n_0 \text { or } m \ge m_0\}
\end {aligned}$$
