> Analyze $$\textsc{Select}$$ to show that if $$n \ge 140$$, then at least $$\lceil n/4 \rceil$$ elements are greater than the median-of-medians $$x$$ and at least $$\lceil n/4 \rceil$$ elements are less than $$x$$.

In the $$\textsc{Select}$$ algorithm with groups of 5, we showed that at least $$3n/10 - 6$$ elements are greater than the median-of-medians $$x$$. We need to prove that for $$n \ge 140$$, this quantity is at least $$\lceil n/4 \rceil$$.

We need to show:

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{3n}{10} - 6 &\ge \left\lceil \frac{n}{4} \right\rceil
\end{align*}$$

Since $$\lceil n/4 \rceil \le n/4 + 1$$, it suffices to show:

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{3n}{10} - 6 &\ge \frac{n}{4} + 1
\end{align*}$$

Rearranging:

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{3n}{10} - \frac{n}{4} &\ge 7 \\
\frac{12n - 10n}{40} &\ge 7 \\
\frac{2n}{40} &\ge 7 \\
\frac{n}{20} &\ge 7 \\
n &\ge 140
\end{align*}$$

So for $$n \ge 140$$, we have $$3n/10 - 6 \ge \lceil n/4 \rceil$$.

Actually, let's verify this more directly. For $$n = 140$$:

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{3 \cdot 140}{10} - 6 &= 42 - 6 = 36 \\
\left\lceil \frac{140}{4} \right\rceil &= 35
\end{align*}$$

Indeed, $$36 \ge 35$$. For $$n > 140$$, the left side grows at rate $$3/10 = 0.3$$ while the right side grows at rate at most $$1/4 = 0.25$$, so the inequality continues to hold.

By symmetry, the same argument shows that at least $$\lceil n/4 \rceil$$ elements are less than $$x$$ when $$n \ge 140$$.

This tighter bound means that when $$n \ge 140$$, the recursive call in step 5 of $$\textsc{Select}$$ is made on at most $$n - \lceil n/4 \rceil \le 3n/4$$ elements, which provides a better guarantee than the $$7n/10 + 6$$ bound used in the textbook analysis.
