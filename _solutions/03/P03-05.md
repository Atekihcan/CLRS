#### A. Asymptotic Non-negative Functions

Notice that if a function is asymptotically non-negative, only information we know about the function is that: asymptotically it'll never be less than zero. However, it can either be monotonically increasing, or a positive contestant, or it can even oscillate between increasing decreasing.

For example, consider the functions $$f(n) = 2$$ and $$g(n) = 2 + sin(n)$$.

The below graph shows the functions, $$f(n)$$ in green and $$g(n)$$ in blue.

{% include graph/graph_P0305.html %}

As it is evident from the graphs, asymptotically, both are non-negative.

Also for infinitely many integers $$n$$, $$f(n) \geq cg(n) \geq$$, for positive constant $$c = 1$$, i.e. $$f(n) = \mathop \Omega \limits^\infty(g(n))$$. This happens whenever the blue graph is below the green one, and there is infinitely many such scenarios.

However, as per definition of $$O$$ or $$\Omega$$, $$f(n)$$ is neither $$O(g(n))$$ nor $$\Omega(g(n))$$.

{% capture note %}
The difference between regular $$\Omega$$ and $$\mathop \Omega \limits^\infty$$, is that in the regular case the definition involves _all $$n$$ greater than a large enough $$n_0$$, whereas in the other case it is for _infinitely many $$n$$_. Although the former includes the later, the opposite is not true as evident from the counter-example shown above.

You can find more discussion on this in the [CS Stack Exchange](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/12147/variations-of-omega-and-omega-infinity){:target="_blank"} forum.

#### B. Advantage and Disadvantage

This directly follows from the previous section: the advantage being we can establish a relationship between any two functions, and the disadvantage being some of those relationships might not be precise enough to be of any use.

#### C. Substitution for Big-O

$$\vert f(n) \vert = O(g(n))$$ implies $$0 \leq \vert f(n) \vert \leq cg(n)$$

As long as $$f(n) \geq 0$$, there is no difference between $$O$$ and $$O'$$. But when $$f(n) < 0$$, $$O$$ notation does not cover such functions, but $$O'$$ does.

With this difference, there is no change in the "if" part but we cannot use the "only if" part anymore as we will need to use negative multiplier constants to find lower limit when $$f(n) < 0$$.

#### D. Ignoring Logarithmic Factors

As logarithmic functions are monotonically increasing, $$\widetilde{\Omega}$$ and $$\widetilde{\Theta}$$ can be defined similarly and theorem 3.1 can be restated without any other changes.
