> Write pseudocode for the brute-force method of solving the maximum-subarray problem. Your procedure should run in $$\Theta(n^2)$$ time.

{% capture code %}
left = low
right = high
sum = -∞
for i = low to high
    tempSum = 0
    for j = i to high
        tempSum = tempSum + A[j]
        if tempSum > sum
            sum = tempSum
            left = i
            right = j
return (left, right, sum)
{% endcapture %}
{% include clrs_code.html title="Find-Maximum-Subarray-BruteForce(A, low, high)" %}

You can find Python implementation of this at the [bottom of the page](#code-editor).

{% capture note %}
Although this algorithm is able to find the correct sum, it will always find the longest sequence, in case there are multiple possible answers. For example, arrays with 0 as the beginning of maximum-subarray.

For $$A = [0, 1, 2]$$, it'll always return $$[1 .. 3]$$ instead of another possible answer $$[2 .. 3]$$

For $$A = [1, -1, 2]$$, it'll always return $$[1 .. 3]$$ instead of another possible answer $$[3 .. 3]$$

Whereas recursive implementation will always return the second ones. You can play with such cases and compare with recursive implementation in the [next exercise]({% link _solutions/04/E04.01-03.md %}){:target='_blank'}.
