### A

We need to arrange the elements {9, 16, 3, 2, 4, 8, 5, 14, 12} in a $$4 \times 4$$ matrix such that rows increase left to right and columns increase top to bottom.

Starting with the smallest element, 2, we place it in the top-left corner. Then we insert the remaining elements one by one. A valid $$4 \times 4$$ Young tableau is:

$$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
\hline
8 & 9 & 12 & 14 \\
\hline
16 & \infty & \infty & \infty \\
\hline
\infty & \infty & \infty & \infty \\
\hline
\end{array}$$

We can verify this is valid: each row increases from left to right (2 < 3 < 4 < 5, etc.), and each column increases from top to bottom (2 < 8 < 16 < $$\infty$$, etc.).

{% capture note %}
There isn't a unique Young tableau for a given set of elements. Different insertion orders can produce different valid tableaus. The tableau shown above is just one possible arrangement.
{% endcapture %}
{% include aside.html title='Multiple valid tableaus exist' %}

### B

Think about what the ordering properties tell us. If $$Y[1,1] = \infty$$, then since every element in the first row must be at least as large as $$Y[1,1]$$ (rows increase left to right), we have $$Y[1,j] = \infty$$ for all $$j$$. Similarly, since every element in the first column must be at least as large as $$Y[1,1]$$ (columns increase top to bottom), we have $$Y[i,1] = \infty$$ for all $$i$$.

But now consider any element $$Y[i,j]$$ with $$i, j > 1$$. We have $$Y[i,j] \geq Y[i,1] = \infty$$ (since columns increase), so $$Y[i,j] = \infty$$. By induction, all elements in the tableau are $$\infty$$, meaning the tableau is empty.

For the second part, if $$Y[m,n] < \infty$$, then $$Y[m,n]$$ is a finite number. Since rows increase left to right, every element in row $$m$$ is finite: $$Y[m,j] \leq Y[m,n] < \infty$$ for all $$j \leq n$$. Similarly, since columns increase top to bottom, every element in column $$n$$ is finite: $$Y[i,n] \leq Y[m,n] < \infty$$ for all $$i \leq m$$.

Now consider any element $$Y[i,j]$$. We have $$Y[i,j] \leq Y[i,n] < \infty$$ (row increases) and $$Y[i,j] \leq Y[m,j] < \infty$$ (column increases). Therefore, every element in the tableau is finite, meaning the tableau contains exactly $$mn$$ elements and is full.

### C

The minimum element in a Young tableau is always at position $$[1,1]$$ because it's smaller than everything in its row and column, which in turn are smaller than everything else in the tableau.

After extracting $$Y[1,1]$$, we need to fill the hole. We replace $$Y[1,1]$$ with $$\infty$$ and then "sink" this $$\infty$$ down to its proper position, similar to $$\textsc{Max-Heapify}$$ but adapted to the two-dimensional structure.

{% capture code %}
min = Y[1, 1]
Y[1, 1] = ∞
Young-Heapify(Y, 1, 1)
return min
{% endcapture %}
{% include clrs_code.html title="Young-Extract-Min(Y)" %}

{% capture code %}
// Find the minimum among current position, right neighbor, and bottom neighbor
min_i = i
min_j = j

// Check right neighbor
if j < n and Y[i, j + 1] < Y[ min_i, min_j ]
    min_i = i
    min_j = j + 1

// Check bottom neighbor
if i < m and Y[i + 1, j] < Y[ min_i, min_j ]
    min_i = i + 1
    min_j = j

// If we found a smaller neighbor, swap and recurse
if min_i ≠ i or min_j ≠ j
    exchange Y[i, j] with Y[ min_i, min_j ]
    Young-Heapify(Y, i, j)(Y, min_i, min_j )
{% endcapture %}
{% include clrs_code.html title="Young-Heapify(Y, i, j)" %}

At each step, we compare at most 3 elements (current position and two neighbors) and swap with one of them, moving either right or down. Let $$T(p)$$ be the maximum running time for a tableau where $$p = m + n$$.

After one step, we recurse on either an $$(m-1) \times n$$ tableau (if we moved down) or an $$m \times (n-1)$$ tableau (if we moved right). In both cases, the new parameter is $$(m-1) + n$$ or $$m + (n-1) = p - 1$$.

This gives us the recurrence:

$$T(p) = T(p-1) + O(1)$$

Solving this recurrence:

$$\begin{align*}
T(p) &= T(p-1) + O(1) \\
     &= T(p-2) + O(1) + O(1) \\
     &= \cdots \\
     &= T(1) + O(p) \\
     &= O(p) \\
     &= O(m + n)
\end{align*}$$

Therefore, $$\textsc{Extract-Min}$$ runs in $$O(m + n)$$ time.

### D

To insert a new element, we use the opposite strategy from extraction. We place the new element at position $$[m,n]$$ (replacing the $$\infty$$ there in a nonfull tableau) and then "bubble" it up and left to its proper position.

{% capture code %}
if Y[m, n] < ∞
    error "tableau is full"
Y[m, n] = key
Young-Bubble-Up(Y, m, n)
{% endcapture %}
{% include clrs_code.html title="Young-Insert(Y, key)" %}

{% capture code %}
// Find the maximum among current position, left neighbor, and top neighbor
max_i = i
max_j = j

// Check left neighbor
if j > 1 and Y[i, j - 1] > Y[ max_i, max_j ]
    max_i = i
    max_j = j - 1

// Check top neighbor
if i > 1 and Y[i - 1, j] > Y[ max_i, max_j ]
    max_i = i - 1
    max_j = j

// If we found a larger neighbor, swap and recurse
if max_i ≠ i or max_j ≠ j
    exchange Y[i, j] with Y[ max_i, max_j ]
    Young-Bubble-Up(Y, i, j)(Y, max_i, max_j )
{% endcapture %}
{% include clrs_code.html title="Young-Bubble-Up(Y, i, j)" %}

The analysis is symmetric to $$\textsc{Extract-Min}$$. At each step, we move either up or left, reducing either $$i$$ or $$j$$ by 1. Starting from position $$[m,n]$$ and moving to position $$[1,1]$$ requires at most $$m-1 + n-1 = m + n - 2$$ moves.

Therefore, $$\textsc{Young-Insert}$$ runs in $$O(m + n)$$ time.

{% capture note %}
The duality between insertion and extraction is elegant: extraction removes the minimum from $$[1,1]$$ and sinks $$\infty$$ toward $$[m,n]$$, while insertion places a new value at $$[m,n]$$ and bubbles it toward $$[1,1]$$. Both operations maintain the Young tableau properties.
{% endcapture %}
{% include aside.html title='Symmetric operations' %}

### E

To sort $$n^2$$ numbers using an $$n \times n$$ Young tableau, we first insert all $$n^2$$ numbers into an initially empty tableau, then extract them one by one in sorted order.

The algorithm is:

1. Initialize an $$n \times n$$ Young tableau with all entries set to $$\infty$$.
2. For each of the $$n^2$$ numbers, call $$\textsc{Young-Insert}$$ to insert it into the tableau.
3. For $$i = 1$$ to $$n^2$$, call $$\textsc{Young-Extract-Min}$$ and store the result in position $$i$$ of the output array.

Each insertion takes $$O(n + n) = O(n)$$ time, and we perform $$n^2$$ insertions, giving $$O(n^3)$$ time for step 2. Each extraction takes $$O(n)$$ time, and we perform $$n^2$$ extractions, giving $$O(n^3)$$ time for step 3.

Therefore, the total running time is $$O(n^3) + O(n^3) = O(n^3)$$.

### F

To search for a value $$x$$ in a Young tableau, we can exploit the ordering properties. Starting from the top-right corner at position $$[1,n]$$, we can eliminate either an entire row or an entire column at each step.

The key observation is that at position $$[i,j]$$:
- All elements to the left in row $$i$$ are smaller than $$Y[i,j]$$
- All elements below in column $$j$$ are larger than $$Y[i,j]$$

So if $$x < Y[i,j]$$, we know $$x$$ cannot be anywhere in column $$j$$ (since all elements in that column below $$[i,j]$$ are even larger). If $$x > Y[i,j]$$, we know $$x$$ cannot be anywhere in row $$i$$ to the left of position $$j$$.

{% capture code %}
i = 1
j = n
while i ≤ m and j ≥ 1
    if Y[i, j] = x
        return (i, j)
    else if Y[i, j] > x
        j = j - 1    // eliminate column j
    else
        i = i + 1    // eliminate row i
return NIL
{% endcapture %}
{% include clrs_code.html title="Young-Search(Y, x)" %}

We start at position $$[1,n]$$ and move either down (incrementing $$i$$) or left (decrementing $$j$$) at each step. We can move down at most $$m-1$$ times and left at most $$n-1$$ times, so the total number of steps is at most $$(m-1) + (n-1) = m + n - 2$$.

Therefore, the algorithm runs in $$O(m + n)$$ time.

{% capture note %}
This search algorithm is similar to searching in a sorted matrix and demonstrates how the two-dimensional ordering constraints of a Young tableau enable efficient operations. The technique of starting from a corner and eliminating rows or columns is a classic approach for searching in sorted matrices.
