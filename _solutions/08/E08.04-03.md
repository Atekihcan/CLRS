> Let $$X$$ be a random variable that is equal to the number of heads in two flips of a fair coin. What is $$\text{E}[X^2]$$? What is $$\text{E}^2[X]$$?

This exercise tests understanding of expected values and the difference between $$\text{E}[X^2]$$ and $$(\text{E}[X])^2$$.

First, let's identify the probability distribution of $$X$$. With two coin flips, the possible outcomes and their probabilities are:
- 0 heads (TT): probability $$1/4$$
- 1 head (HT or TH): probability $$1/2$$
- 2 heads (HH): probability $$1/4$$

### Computing $$\text{E}[X]$$

The expected number of heads is:

$$\begin{align*}
\text{E}[X] &= 0 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 1 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \\
            &= 0 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \\
            &= 1
\end{align*}$$

This makes intuitive sense: on average, we expect 1 head in 2 flips.

### Computing $$\text{E}[X^2]$$

We need to find the expected value of $$X^2$$:

$$\begin{align*}
\text{E}[X^2] &= 0^2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 1^2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 2^2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \\
              &= 0 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 1 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \\
              &= 0 + \frac{1}{2} + 1 \\
              &= \frac{3}{2}
\end{align*}$$

### Computing $$\text{E}^2[X]$$

This is the square of the expected value:

$$\begin{align*}
\text{E}^2[X] &= (\text{E}[X])^2 \\
              &= 1^2 \\
              &= 1
\end{align*}$$

### Results

$$\boxed{\text{E}[X^2] = \frac{3}{2}, \quad \text{E}^2[X] = 1}$$

Note that $$\text{E}[X^2] \neq \text{E}^2[X]$$ in general. The difference $$\text{E}[X^2] - \text{E}^2[X]$$ is the variance of $$X$$, which measures how spread out the distribution is.

This exercise appears because it's related to analyzing bucket sort's expected running time. The variance calculation $$\text{E}[n_i^2] - (\text{E}[n_i])^2$$ is used in equation (8.2) of the text to bound the expected number of elements in each bucket.
