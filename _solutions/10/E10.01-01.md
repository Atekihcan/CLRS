> Using Figure 10.1 as a model, illustrate the result of each operation in the sequence $$\textsc{Push}$$($$S$$, 4), $$\textsc{Push}$$($$S$$, 1), $$\textsc{Push}$$($$S$$, 3), $$\textsc{Pop}$$($$S$$), $$\textsc{Push}$$($$S$$, 8), and $$\textsc{Pop}$$($$S$$) on an initially empty stack $$S$$ stored in array $$S[1..6]$$.

We start with an empty stack where $$S.\textit{top} = 0$$. Let's trace through each operation:

**After $$\textsc{Push}$$($$S$$, 4):** The first element is pushed onto the stack. The top pointer increments to 1, and $$S[1] = 4$$.

```
[4][_][_][_][_][_]
 ↑
S.top = 1
```

**After $$\textsc{Push}$$($$S$$, 1):** We push 1 onto the stack. The top pointer increments to 2, and $$S[2] = 1$$.

```
[4][1][_][_][_][_]
    ↑
S.top = 2
```

**After $$\textsc{Push}$$($$S$$, 3):** We push 3 onto the stack. The top pointer increments to 3, and $$S[3] = 3$$.

```
[4][1][3][_][_][_]
       ↑
S.top = 3
```

**After $$\textsc{Pop}$$($$S$$):** The top element (3) is removed. The top pointer decrements to 2. The value 3 is returned, but it still remains in the array.

```
[4][1][3][_][_][_]
    ↑
S.top = 2
```

**After $$\textsc{Push}$$($$S$$, 8):** We push 8 onto the stack. The top pointer increments to 3, and $$S[3] = 8$$. Note that this overwrites the previous value at index 3.

```
[4][1][8][_][_][_]
       ↑
S.top = 3
```

**After $$\textsc{Pop}$$($$S$$):** The top element (8) is removed. The top pointer decrements to 2. The value 8 is returned.

```
[4][1][8][_][_][_]
    ↑
S.top = 2
```

The final state has $$S.\textit{top} = 2$$ with elements 4 and 1 in the stack. Elements at indices 3-6 are not part of the active stack, even though index 3 contains the value 8 from a previous operation.
