{% capture note %}
If you are looking for implementing the algorithm, the main challenges would be in partitioning a matrix in quadrants, especially when the dimensions are not divisible by 2, i.e. initial matrix dimensions are not power of 2. Also recombining the partitioned quadrant will need some thoughts.

You can find thorough and detailed implementations [here](<https://martin-thoma.com/strassen-algorithm-in-python-java-cpp/> 'Implementation of Strassen's Algorithm'){:target='_blank'}.
