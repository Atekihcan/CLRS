> Draw a picture of the sequence ⟨13, 4, 8, 19, 5, 11⟩ stored as a doubly linked list using the multiple-array representation. Do the same for the single-array representation.

We'll represent the sequence ⟨13, 4, 8, 19, 5, 11⟩ as a doubly linked list where the elements appear in this order.

### Multiple-Array Representation

In this representation, we use three separate arrays: $$\textit{key}$$, $$\textit{next}$$, and $$\textit{prev}$$. Each array index represents an object. Let's say $$L = 1$$ (the list head is at index 1).

```
Index:    1    2    3    4    5    6
key:    [13] [ 4] [ 8] [19] [ 5] [11]
next:   [ 2] [ 3] [ 4] [ 5] [ 6] [ /]
prev:   [ /] [ 1] [ 2] [ 3] [ 4] [ 5]
          ↑
          L
```

Where `/` represents $$\textsc{Nil}$$.

The list structure is:
- Index 1: key=13, next=2, prev=NIL (head)
- Index 2: key=4, next=3, prev=1
- Index 3: key=8, next=4, prev=2
- Index 4: key=19, next=5, prev=3
- Index 5: key=5, next=6, prev=4
- Index 6: key=11, next=NIL, prev=5 (tail)

### Single-Array Representation

In this representation, we use a single array $$A$$ where each object occupies three consecutive positions. If we use offsets 0, 1, 2 for $$\textit{key}$$, $$\textit{next}$$, $$\textit{prev}$$ respectively:

```
Index:  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
A:     [13  4  / ][ 4  7  1 ][ 8 10  4 ][19 13  7 ][ 5 16 10 ][11  / 13]
        ↑          ↑          ↑          ↑          ↑          ↑
      obj 1      obj 2      obj 3      obj 4      obj 5      obj 6

L = 1 (pointer to first object)
```

Where `/` represents $$\textsc{Nil}$$ (or 0).

The objects are:
- Object at index 1: key=13, next=4, prev=NIL (points to object 2 at index 4)
- Object at index 4: key=4, next=7, prev=1 (points to object 3 at index 7)
- Object at index 7: key=8, next=10, prev=4 (points to object 4 at index 10)
- Object at index 10: key=19, next=13, prev=7 (points to object 5 at index 13)
- Object at index 13: key=5, next=16, prev=10 (points to object 6 at index 16)
- Object at index 16: key=11, next=NIL, prev=13 (tail)

Each object occupies 3 consecutive array positions, and pointers are array indices (pointing to the first position of each object).
