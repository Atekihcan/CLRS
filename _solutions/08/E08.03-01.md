> Using Figure 8.3 as a model, illustrate the operation of $$\textsc{Radix-Sort}$$ on the following list of English words: COW, DOG, SEA, RUG, ROW, MOB, BOX, TAB, BAR, EAR, TAR, DIG, BIG, TEA, NOW, FOX.

Each word has 3 letters, so we sort on 3 digits (positions), starting from the least significant (rightmost) position.

**Initial list:**

```
COW  DOG  SEA  RUG  ROW  MOB  BOX  TAB
BAR  EAR  TAR  DIG  BIG  TEA  NOW  FOX
```

**After sorting on position 3 (last letter):**

Group by last letter and sort stable within each group:
- Ending in G: DOG, RUG, DIG, BIG
- Ending in R: BAR, EAR, TAR
- Ending in W: COW, ROW, NOW
- Ending in B: MOB, TAB
- Ending in A: SEA, TEA
- Ending in X: BOX, FOX

```
DOG  RUG  DIG  BIG  BAR  EAR  TAR  COW
ROW  NOW  MOB  TAB  SEA  TEA  BOX  FOX
```

**After sorting on position 2 (middle letter):**

Group by middle letter:
- A: BAR, EAR, TAR, TAB
- E: SEA, TEA
- I: DIG, BIG
- O: DOG, COW, ROW, NOW, MOB, BOX, FOX
- U: RUG

```
BAR  EAR  TAR  TAB  SEA  TEA  DIG  BIG
DOG  COW  ROW  NOW  MOB  BOX  FOX  RUG
```

**After sorting on position 1 (first letter):**

Final grouping by first letter:
- B: BAR, BIG, BOX
- C: COW
- D: DIG, DOG
- E: EAR
- F: FOX
- M: MOB
- N: NOW
- R: ROW, RUG
- S: SEA
- T: TAB, TAR, TEA

```
BAR  BIG  BOX  COW  DIG  DOG  EAR  FOX
MOB  NOW  ROW  RUG  SEA  TAB  TAR  TEA
```

The words are now sorted alphabetically! The stability of the intermediate sorts ensures that words with the same leading characters maintain the correct relative order based on their later characters.
