> Prove the lower bound of $$\lceil 3n/2 \rceil - 2$$ comparisons in the worst case to find both the maximum and minimum of $$n$$ numbers. (Hint: Consider how many numbers are potentially either the maximum or minimum, and investigate how a comparison affects these counts.)

To establish a lower bound, we will track how many elements are still candidates for being the maximum or minimum. Initially, all $$n$$ elements are potential candidates for both the maximum and the minimum, giving us $$2n$$ potential relationships that need to be resolved.

An element can be eliminated as a candidate for maximum when it loses a comparison (proves it is not the largest). Similarly, an element can be eliminated as a candidate for minimum when it wins a comparison (proves it is not the smallest). To correctly determine both the maximum and minimum, we must eliminate all but one candidate for maximum and all but one candidate for minimum, reducing from $$2n$$ candidates to exactly 2.

Let us analyze how different types of comparisons eliminate candidates. When we compare two elements $$x$$ and $$y$$:

**Case 1:** Both $$x$$ and $$y$$ are candidates for both max and min (haven't been compared yet). If $$x < y$$, then $$x$$ is eliminated as a max candidate and $$y$$ is eliminated as a min candidate. This eliminates 2 candidates with 1 comparison.

**Case 2:** One element is a max-only candidate and the other is a min-only candidate. The comparison provides no new information (we already know max-candidates are larger than min-candidates), so this eliminates 0 candidates.

**Case 3:** We are comparing two max-only candidates or two min-only candidates. This eliminates 1 candidate with 1 comparison.

To minimize the number of comparisons, an adversary would force us to make comparisons that eliminate candidates as slowly as possible. The optimal strategy is to first pair up elements and compare them (Case 1 comparisons), which uses $$\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$$ comparisons and eliminates $$2 \lfloor n/2 \rfloor = n - (n \bmod 2)$$ candidates.

After this pairing phase:
- For even $$n$$: We have $$n/2$$ max candidates and $$n/2$$ min candidates
- For odd $$n$$: We have $$(n+1)/2$$ max candidates and $$(n+1)/2$$ min candidates (one element remains unpaired)

Now we must reduce each group to a single element using Case 3 comparisons (which eliminate 1 candidate each):
- Finding the maximum among max candidates requires $$\lceil n/2 \rceil - 1$$ comparisons
- Finding the minimum among min candidates requires $$\lceil n/2 \rceil - 1$$ comparisons

The total number of comparisons is:

$$\begin{align*}
\lfloor n/2 \rfloor + 2(\lceil n/2 \rceil - 1) &= \lfloor n/2 \rfloor + 2\lceil n/2 \rceil - 2
\end{align*}$$

For even $$n$$: $$\frac{n}{2} + 2 \cdot \frac{n}{2} - 2 = \frac{3n}{2} - 2 = \lceil 3n/2 \rceil - 2$$

For odd $$n$$: $$\frac{n-1}{2} + 2 \cdot \frac{n+1}{2} - 2 = \frac{n-1 + 2n + 2}{2} - 2 = \frac{3n+1}{2} - 2 = \lceil 3n/2 \rceil - 2$$

Therefore, any algorithm must make at least $$\lceil 3n/2 \rceil - 2$$ comparisons in the worst case to find both the maximum and minimum.
