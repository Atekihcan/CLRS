> An $$m \times n$$ array $$A$$ of real numbers is a **Monge array** if for all $$i, j, k,$$ and $$l$$ such that $$1 \le i < k \le m$$ and $$1 \le j < l \le n$$, we have:
>
> $$A[i,j] + A[k,l] \le A[i,l] + A[k,j]$$

In other words, whenever we pick two rows and two columns and consider the four elements at their intersections, the sum of the upper-left and lower-right elements is $$\le$$ the sum of the lower-left and upper-right elements.

### Part (a): Prove equivalence with adjacent-pair condition

**To prove:** An array is Monge if and only if for all $$i = 1, 2, \ldots, m-1$$ and $$j = 1, 2, \ldots, n-1$$:

$$A[i,j] + A[i+1,j+1] \le A[i,j+1] + A[i+1,j]$$

**Proof ($$\Leftarrow$$):** Assume the adjacent condition holds. We prove the general Monge condition by induction.

*Base case:* For $$k = i+1$$ and $$l = j+1$$, this is exactly the adjacent condition.

*Inductive step:* 

**Row induction:** Suppose $$A[i,j] + A[k,l] \le A[i,l] + A[k,j]$$ holds. We prove it for $$k+1$$:

$$\begin{align}
A[i,j] + A[k+1,l] &\le A[i,j] + A[k,l] + (A[k+1,l] - A[k,l])\\
&\le A[i,l] + A[k,j] + (A[k+1,l] - A[k,l])\\
&= A[i,l] + A[k+1,j] + (A[k,l] - A[k,l])\\
&\quad - (A[k+1,j] - A[k,j]) + (A[k+1,l] - A[k,l])\\
&\le A[i,l] + A[k+1,j]
\end{align}$$

The last inequality follows from applying the adjacent condition to rows $$k$$ and $$k+1$$, columns $$j$$ and $$l$$.

**Column induction:** Similar argument extends to $$l+1$$.

**Proof ($$\Rightarrow$$):** The general condition with $$k=i+1, l=j+1$$ gives the adjacent condition directly.

### Part (b): Fix the non-Monge array

Given array:
```
37 23 22 32
21  6  7 10
53 34 30 31
32 13  9  6
43 21 15  8
```

Check adjacent pairs systematically. For example, check $$A[2,2] + A[3,3]$$ vs $$A[2,3] + A[3,2]$$:

$$6 + 30 = 36 > 7 + 34 = 41$$ ✗ (violates Monge)

We need $$A[2,2] + A[3,3] \le A[2,3] + A[3,2]$$.

**Change:** Modify $$A[2,2]$$ from $$6$$ to $$11$$ (or adjust other elements).

Checking: $$11 + 30 = 41 \not> 7 + 34 = 41$$ ✓

### Part (c): Prove leftmost minima property

Let $$f(i)$$ be the column index of the leftmost minimum in row $$i$$.

**To prove:** $$f(1) \le f(2) \le \cdots \le f(m)$$ for any $$m \times n$$ Monge array.

**Proof by contradiction:**

Assume $$f(i) > f(i+1)$$ for some $$i$$. Let $$j = f(i+1)$$ and $$l = f(i)$$.

By definition:
- $$A[i+1, j] \le A[i+1, l]$$ ($$j$$ is leftmost min of row $$i+1$$)
- $$A[i, l] \le A[i, j]$$ ($$l$$ is leftmost min of row $$i$$, and $$j < l$$)

Adding these: $$A[i+1,j] + A[i,l] \le A[i+1,l] + A[i,j]$$

But the Monge property requires:  
$$A[i,j] + A[i+1,l] \le A[i,l] + A[i+1,j]$$

Rearranging: $$A[i+1,j] + A[i,l] \ge A[i+1,l] + A[i,j]$$

For both to hold, we need equality:  
$$A[i+1,j] + A[i,l] = A[i+1,l] + A[i,j]$$

But this contradicts our assumption that $$f(i) > f(i+1)$$ (strict inequality in definitions).

### Part (d): Divide-and-conquer algorithm

**Algorithm:**

1. Construct submatrix $$A'$$ with even-numbered rows of $$A$$
2. Recursively find leftmost minima for each row of $$A'$$  
3. Compute leftmost minima for odd-numbered rows of $$A$$ using the results from step 2

**Computing odd-row minima in $$O(m+n)$$ time:**

For odd row $$i$$, we know:
- $$f(i-1)$$ (from even row $$i-1$$, found recursively)
- $$f(i+1)$$ (from even row $$i+1$$, found recursively)

By part (c): $$f(i-1) \le f(i) \le f(i+1)$$

So we only search columns $$[f(i-1), f(i+1)]$$ for row $$i$$.

Total work for all $$m/2$$ odd rows: Each column is examined at most twice (once from above, once from below), giving $$O(m+n)$$ total.

### Part (e): Recurrence and solution

**Recurrence:**

$$T(m,n) = T(m/2, n) + O(m + n)$$

**Solution:**

$$\begin{align}
T(m,n) &= T(m/2,n) + c(m+n)\\
&= T(m/4,n) + c(m/2+n) + c(m+n)\\
&= T(m/2^k,n) + c\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}(m/2^i + n)\\
&= T(1,n) + c(2m + kn)\\
&= O(n) + c(2m + n\lg m)\\
&= O(m + n\lg m)
\end{align}$$

where $$k = \lg m$$ (when $$m/2^k = 1$$).

{% capture note %}
The Monge property provides powerful structure that enables efficient algorithms. The leftmost minimum property allows us to use divide-and-conquer to find all row minima in $$O(m + n\lg m)$$ time, much better than the naive $$O(mn)$$ approach. Monge arrays appear in many optimization problems including dynamic programming and facility location.
