> Is an array that is in sorted order a min-heap?

Yes, a sorted array (in increasing order) is always a min-heap. Let's see why this is true.

For an array to be a min-heap, it must satisfy the min-heap property: for every node $$i$$ other than the root, we must have:

$$A[\textsc{Parent}(i)] \le A[i]$$

In other words, every parent must be less than or equal to its children. Now consider a sorted array $$A[1], A[2], \ldots, A[n]$$ where $$A[1] \le A[2] \le \cdots \le A[n]$$.

For any node at index $$i$$, its parent is at index $$\lfloor i/2 \rfloor$$ and its children (if they exist) are at indices $$2i$$ and $$2i + 1$$. We need to verify that:

$$A[\lfloor i/2 \rfloor] \le A[i]$$

Since the array is sorted and $$\lfloor i/2 \rfloor < i$$ (for all $$i > 1$$), we have:

$$A[\lfloor i/2 \rfloor] \le A[i]$$

This holds for all nodes $$i > 1$$, so the min-heap property is satisfied everywhere.

For example, the sorted array $$\langle 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \rangle$$ is a valid min-heap. As a tree, it looks like:

![Sorted Array as Min-Heap]({{ '/assets/img/06/6.1-5_tree.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }} "Sorted array as min-heap")

Each parent is indeed smaller than its children.
