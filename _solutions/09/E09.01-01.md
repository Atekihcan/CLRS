> Show that the second smallest of $$n$$ elements can be found with $$n + \lceil \lg n \rceil - 2$$ comparisons in the worst case. (Hint: Also find the smallest element.)

Think of finding the minimum as a tournament where elements compete in pairwise matches, with the smaller element winning each match. After $$n - 1$$ comparisons, we have a winner (the minimum element). The key insight is that the second smallest element must have lost directly to the minimum at some point in this tournament.

Why? Consider any element that never competed against the minimum. Such an element must have lost to some other element (since only the minimum remains undefeated). But that means it is larger than at least one non-minimum element, so it cannot be the second smallest.

Therefore, the second smallest must be among the elements that lost directly to the minimum. How many such elements are there? In an efficient tournament structure (a balanced binary tree), the minimum competes in exactly $$\lceil \lg n \rceil$$ matches on its path to victory. Each of these matches produces one element that lost directly to the minimum.

To find the second smallest, we first run the tournament to find the minimum ($$n - 1$$ comparisons), keeping track of which elements lost directly to the minimum. Then we find the minimum among these $$\lceil \lg n \rceil$$ candidates, which requires $$\lceil \lg n \rceil - 1$$ additional comparisons.

The total number of comparisons is:

$$\begin{align*}
(n - 1) + (\lceil \lg n \rceil - 1) &= n + \lceil \lg n \rceil - 2
\end{align*}$$

This is tight because we must make at least $$n - 1$$ comparisons to determine the minimum (every element except the minimum must lose at least once), and we must make at least $$\lceil \lg n \rceil - 1$$ comparisons among the candidates for second smallest.
