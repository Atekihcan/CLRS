> Describe a $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$-time algorithm that, given a set $$S$$ of $$n$$ integers and another integer $$x$$, determines whether or not there exist two elements in $$S$$ whose sum is exactly $$x$$.

If the running time constraint was not there, we might have intuitively used the brute-force method of picking one element at a time and iterating over the set to check if there exists another element in the set such that sum of them is $$x$$. Even in average case, this brute-force algorithm will run at $$\Theta(n^2)$$ time (as we have to iterate over the set for each element).

But we have to think of a $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$-time algorithm.

{% capture note %}
Every time we see $$\lg n$$, we should think of divide-and-conquer algorithms. It inherently means how many times $$n$$ can be divided by $$2$$, i.e. repeated division of $$n$$ elements in two  groups.

So, the problem asks for a search algorithm and we already know ***binary search*** is an efficient one at that which runs at $$\Theta(\lg n)$$ time for a sorted array (see [Exercise 2.3-5]({% link _solutions/02/E02.03-05.md %})).

So, we can sort the array with merge sort ($$\Theta(n \lg n)$$) and then for each element $$S[i]$$ in the array, we can do a binary search for $$x - S[i]$$ on the sorted array ($$\Theta(n \lg n)$$). So, the overall algorithm will run at $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$ time.

{% capture code %}
Merge-Sort(S, 1, S.length)
for i = 1 to S.length
    index = Binary-Search(S, x - S[i])
    if index != NIL and index != i
        return true
return false
{% endcapture %}
{% include clrs_code.html title="Sum-Search(S, x)" %}

Note the additional conditional check for $$index$$ not being equal to $$i$$ in line 4. This is necessary for avoiding cases where the expected sum, $$x$$, is twice of any element. An algorithm without this conditional check, will wrongly return **true** in such cases. This was pointed out by Ravi in the comments.

{% capture note %}
Definitely not! There are much better algorithms available for solving this problem, some which actually runs at linear time. Check out [this GeeksforGeeks article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-an-array-a-and-a-number-x-check-for-pair-in-a-with-sum-as-x/){:target="_blank"} for a detailed discussion on some other methods.

We are not discussing those solutions here as the problem specifically asked for a $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$ algorithm, and some of the better algorithm needs understanding of *hash table* data structure, that has not been introduced yet in the book. The motivation for this solution was to solve this problem with  what we have learnt till now.

However, another $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$ algorithm is discussed below, which is slightly different for the searching part.

This problem can be solved in another way which still uses a $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$ sorting procedure but instead of using $$\textsc {Binary-Search}$$, it uses a ***two-way search***, i.e. simultaneous search from both end of the array, to check if two elements sums up to expected sum, $$x$$.

{% capture code %}
Merge-Sort(S, 1, S.length)
left = 1
right = S.length
while (left < right)
    if S[left] + S[right] == x
        return true
    else if S[left + S[right] < x
        left = left + 1
    else
        right = right - 1
return false
