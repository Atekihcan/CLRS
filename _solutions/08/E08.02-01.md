> Using Figure 8.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of $$\textsc{Counting-Sort}$$ on the array $$A = \langle 6, 0, 2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 1, 3, 2 \rangle$$.

Let me trace through the algorithm step by step. We have $$n = 11$$ and $$k = 6$$ (maximum value).

**Initial state:**

$$
A = [6, 0, 2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 1, 3, 2]
$$

**After lines 2-3** (initialize $$C$$ to zeros):

$$
C = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
$$

**After lines 4-5** (count occurrences):

Count how many times each value appears:
- 0 appears 2 times
- 1 appears 2 times
- 2 appears 2 times
- 3 appears 2 times
- 4 appears 1 time
- 5 appears 0 times
- 6 appears 2 times

$$
C = [2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2]
$$

**After lines 7-8** (cumulative sum):

Each $$C[i]$$ now contains the number of elements $$\leq i$$:

$$
C = [2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 9, 11]
$$

**Processing loop (lines 10-12)** working backward through $$A$$:

Process $$A[11] = 2$$: $$B[C[2]] = B[6] = 2$$, then $$C[2] = 5$$

Process $$A[10] = 3$$: $$B[C[3]] = B[8] = 3$$, then $$C[3] = 7$$

Process $$A[9] = 1$$: $$B[C[1]] = B[4] = 1$$, then $$C[1] = 3$$

Process $$A[8] = 6$$: $$B[C[6]] = B[11] = 6$$, then $$C[6] = 10$$

Process $$A[7] = 4$$: $$B[C[4]] = B[9] = 4$$, then $$C[4] = 8$$

Process $$A[6] = 3$$: $$B[C[3]] = B[7] = 3$$, then $$C[3] = 6$$

Process $$A[5] = 1$$: $$B[C[1]] = B[3] = 1$$, then $$C[1] = 2$$

Process $$A[4] = 0$$: $$B[C[0]] = B[2] = 0$$, then $$C[0] = 1$$

Process $$A[3] = 2$$: $$B[C[2]] = B[5] = 2$$, then $$C[2] = 4$$

Process $$A[2] = 0$$: $$B[C[0]] = B[1] = 0$$, then $$C[0] = 0$$

Process $$A[1] = 6$$: $$B[C[6]] = B[10] = 6$$, then $$C[6] = 9$$

**Final sorted output:**

$$
B = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6]
$$

The array is now sorted! Notice how the algorithm is stable: the two 0's, two 1's, two 2's, two 3's, and two 6's maintain their relative order from the input.
