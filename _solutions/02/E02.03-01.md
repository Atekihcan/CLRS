> Using Figure 2.4 as a model, illustrate the operation of merge sort on the array $$A = \langle3, 41, 52, 26, 38, 57, 9, 49\rangle$$.

![Merge Sort]({{ '/assets/img/02/2.3-1_merge_sort.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }} "Merge sort illustration")

The figure is slightly different than the one in the book. The figure in the book was showing sorting progress from bottom to up. Here it is shown from top to bottom, which I feel will be more intuitive to understand.
