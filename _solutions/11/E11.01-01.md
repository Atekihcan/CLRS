> Suppose that a dynamic set $$S$$ is represented by a direct-address table $$T$$ of length $$m$$. Describe a procedure that finds the maximum element of $$S$$. What is the worst-case performance of your procedure?

To find the maximum element in a direct-address table, we need to scan the table from the highest index downward until we find the first non-$$\textsc{Nil}$$ entry. Since keys are stored at index positions equal to their values, the first non-empty slot we encounter from the end contains the maximum key.

The procedure is straightforward. We start at index $$m - 1$$ and move backward through the table. Each position either contains an element (in which case that element's key equals the index) or contains $$\textsc{Nil}$$. The first non-$$\textsc{Nil}$$ entry we find has the largest key value in the set.

{% capture code %}
DirectAddressMaximum(T)
    for i = T.length - 1 downto 0
        if T[i] ≠ NIL
            return T[i]
    return NIL
{% endcapture %}

In the worst case, all elements in $$S$$ are stored near the beginning of the table (small key values), and most of the table is empty. We would need to scan through all the empty slots starting from index $$m - 1$$ down to wherever the maximum element is stored.

More precisely, if the maximum key in $$S$$ is $$k_{\max}$$, then we perform $$m - k_{\max}$$ comparisons in the worst case. When $$k_{\max}$$ is very small (close to 0) and $$m$$ is large, this approaches $$m$$ comparisons.

Therefore, the worst-case running time is $$\Theta(m)$$, linear in the size of the table rather than the number of elements stored. This is unavoidable with a direct-address table when we don't maintain additional information about which slots are occupied. If we know $$n$$, the number of elements, we could maintain a separate sorted list of keys for $$O(\log n)$$ maximum queries, but that would require additional space and complicate insertions and deletions.

**Contrast with Hash Tables**

This exercise highlights a key difference between direct-address tables and other data structures. With a balanced binary search tree, finding the maximum takes $$O(\log n)$$ time where $$n$$ is the number of stored elements. With a direct-address table, it takes $$O(m)$$ time where $$m$$ is the size of the universe, which can be much larger than $$n$$.
