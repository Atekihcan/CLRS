> What is the difference between the binary-search-tree property and the min-heap property (see page 153)? Can the min-heap property be used to print out the keys of an $$n$$-node tree in sorted order in $$O(n)$$ time? Show how, or explain why not.

The two properties impose different ordering constraints on tree nodes.

The **binary-search-tree property** states that for any node $$x$$:
- All keys in the left subtree of $$x$$ are at most $$x.\textit{key}$$
- All keys in the right subtree of $$x$$ are at least $$x.\textit{key}$$

This property enables an inorder traversal to print keys in sorted order because we visit left descendants (smaller), then the node itself, then right descendants (larger).

The **min-heap property** states that for any node $$x$$:
- $$x.\textit{key} \le y.\textit{key}$$ for all descendants $$y$$ of $$x$$
- Equivalently, the parent is smaller than or equal to both children

This property only ensures that the minimum element is at the root and parents are smaller than children, but makes no distinction between left and right subtrees.

**Can we print min-heap keys in sorted order in** $$O(n)$$ **time?**

No, we cannot. Consider this min-heap:

```
      1
     / \
    4   3
   / \
  8   7
```

An inorder traversal would give: $$8, 4, 7, 1, 3$$, which is not sorted. A preorder traversal gives: $$1, 4, 8, 7, 3$$ (not sorted). A postorder traversal gives: $$8, 7, 4, 3, 1$$ (reverse sorted, but only by coincidence).

The only way to extract keys from a min-heap in sorted order is to repeatedly extract the minimum (the root) and restore the heap property each time. This takes $$O(n \lg n)$$ time using $$n$$ calls to $$\textsc{Extract-Min}$$, each taking $$O(\lg n)$$ time.

{% capture note %}
The min-heap property provides no ordering between left and right subtrees. For example, in the heap above, the right child (3) is smaller than the left child (4), but both satisfy the min-heap property of being larger than their parent (1).

A binary search tree with the same keys might look like:

```
      4
     / \
    1   7
     \   \
      3   8
```

An inorder traversal gives: $$1, 3, 4, 7, 8$$ (sorted).

The fundamental difference: BST property establishes a global left-to-right ordering, while the heap property only establishes a local parent-child ordering.
