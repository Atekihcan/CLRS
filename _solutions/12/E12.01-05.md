> Argue that since sorting $$n$$ elements takes $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$ time in the worst case in the comparison model, any comparison-based algorithm for constructing a binary search tree from an arbitrary list of $$n$$ elements takes $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$ time in the worst case.

This is a reduction argument: if we could build a BST faster than $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$ time, we could use it to sort faster than the known lower bound, which is impossible.

Suppose we have a comparison-based algorithm $$\mathcal{A}$$ that constructs a binary search tree from $$n$$ elements in $$o(n \lg n)$$ time (asymptotically faster than $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$). We can use this algorithm to sort:

1. Use algorithm $$\mathcal{A}$$ to build a BST from the $$n$$ elements: $$o(n \lg n)$$ time
2. Perform an inorder tree walk to print elements in sorted order: $$\Theta(n)$$ time
3. Total time: $$o(n \lg n) + \Theta(n) = o(n \lg n)$$

This would give us a comparison-based sorting algorithm that runs in $$o(n \lg n)$$ time, contradicting the well-known lower bound that any comparison-based sorting algorithm requires $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$ comparisons in the worst case.

Since no such algorithm $$\mathcal{A}$$ can exist, any comparison-based algorithm for constructing a BST must take at least $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$ time in the worst case.

{% capture note %}
This argument is an example of a **reduction**: we reduce the sorting problem to the BST construction problem. If BST construction were "easy" (faster than $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$), then sorting would also be easy, which we know is false.

The key steps in this reduction are:
1. BST construction (assumed to be fast)
2. Inorder traversal (known to be $$\Theta(n)$$)

Since step 2 is already optimal for visiting all nodes, any speedup must come from step 1. But we've shown step 1 cannot be faster than $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$ without contradicting the sorting lower bound.

Note that this lower bound applies to *any* comparison-based BST construction algorithm. Specific algorithms might achieve this bound (like repeated insertion into an initially empty tree can take $$\Theta(n^2)$$ in the worst case), but none can do better than $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$ on all inputs.

The argument relies on the fact that:
1. The comparison model lower bound for sorting is $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$
2. An inorder traversal of a BST produces sorted output
3. Inorder traversal takes $$\Theta(n)$$ time

Therefore, BST construction must take $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$ time, as it solves the sorting problem.
