In HIRE-ASSISTANT, assuming that the candidates are presented in a random order, what is the probability that you hire exactly twice?

Hiring exactly twice means we update our current best candidate exactly two times: once for the first candidate (who we always hire), and once more for exactly one subsequent candidate.

Let's rank the candidates from 1 (worst) to $$n$$ (best). For us to hire exactly twice, the best-qualified candidate (rank $$n$$) must appear at some position $$k \geq 2$$, and when they arrive, they must be better than our current best. More importantly, for this to be only the second hire, no candidate between positions 2 and $$k-1$$ can trigger a hire.

### Building the Solution

Consider the best candidate appearing at position $$k$$ where $$2 \leq k \leq n$$. For exactly two hires to occur:

1. The best candidate is at position $$k$$ (probability $$1/n$$)
2. Among the first $$k-1$$ positions, position 1 must have the highest rank (otherwise we'd hire someone between positions 2 and $$k-1$$)

Given that we have $$k-1$$ candidates in positions 1 through $$k-1$$, the probability that position 1 has the maximum rank among them is $$1/(k-1)$$.

Using the law of total probability, we sum over all possible positions $$k$$ for the best candidate:

$$\begin{align*}
\Pr\{\text{hire exactly twice}\} &= \sum_{k=2}^{n} \Pr\{\text{best at position } k\} \cdot \Pr\{\text{position 1 best in } 1..k-1\} \\
&= \sum_{k=2}^{n} \frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{1}{k-1} \\
&= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=2}^{n} \frac{1}{k-1} \\
&= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{j} \\
&= \frac{1}{n} H_{n-1}
\end{align*}$$

where $$H_{n-1} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n-1}$$ is the $$(n-1)$$-th harmonic number.

### Final Answer

$$\Pr\{\text{hire exactly twice}\} = \frac{H_{n-1}}{n} \approx \frac{\ln n}{n}$$

For large $$n$$, this probability decreases as $$\Theta(\ln n / n)$$.

**Numerical Example**

For $$n = 10$$ candidates:
- $$H_9 = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \cdots + \frac{1}{9} \approx 2.829$$
- $$\Pr\{\text{hire exactly twice}\} \approx \frac{2.829}{10} \approx 0.283$$ or about 28.3%

This is much more likely than hiring all 10 times (probability $$\approx 0.00000028$$) but less likely than hiring exactly once (probability $$= 0.1$$ or 10%).
