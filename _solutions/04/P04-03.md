> Give asymptotic upper and lower bounds for $$T(n)$$ in each of the following recurrences. Assume that $$T(n)$$ is constant for sufficiently small $$n$$. Make your bounds as tight as possible, and justify your answers.

This problem presents more complex recurrences that test understanding of the master theorem and other solution techniques.

### Part (a): $$T(n) = 4T(n/3) + n \lg n$$

$$a=4, b=3, f(n)=n \lg n$$

$$n^{\log_b a} = n^{\log_3 4} \approx n^{1.262}$$

Since $$f(n) = n \lg n$$ grows slower than $$n^{1.262}$$ (logarithmic factor doesn't change polynomial order), we have $$f(n) = O(n^{\log_3 4 - \epsilon})$$ for small $$\epsilon$$.

**Case 1:** $$T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_3 4})$$

### Part (b): $$T(n) = 3T(n/3) + n/\lg n$$

$$a=3, b=3, n^{\log_b a} = n$$

Here $$f(n) = n/\lg n$$ is polynomially smaller than $$n$$ but not by a factor of $$n^\epsilon$$. The master theorem does **not apply** (falls in the gap between cases 1 and 2).

Using other methods: $$T(n) = \Theta(n)$$

### Part (c): $$T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n^2\sqrt{n}$$

$$a=4, b=2, f(n)=n^{2.5}, n^{\log_b a} = n^2$$

$$f(n) = n^{2.5} = \Omega(n^{2+0.5})$$

Check regularity: $$4f(n/2) = 4(n/2)^{2.5} = n^{2.5}/2^{1.5} < cf(n)$$ for $$c = 1/2^{1.5} < 1$$.

**Case 3:** $$T(n) = \Theta(n^{2.5}) = \Theta(n^2\sqrt{n})$$

### Part (d): $$T(n) = 3T(n/3-2) + n/2$$

The $$-2$$ term is a low-order perturbation. For large $$n$$, this behaves like $$T(n) = 3T(n/3) + n/2$$.

$$a=3, b=3, f(n)=n/2, n^{\log_b a} = n$$

**Case 2:** $$T(n) = \Theta(n \lg n)$$

### Part (e): $$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n/\lg n$$

$$a=2, b=2, f(n)=n/\lg n, n^{\log_b a} = n$$

Master theorem doesn't apply (gap case). 

Using recursion tree: $$T(n) = \Theta(n \lg \lg n)$$

### Part (f): $$T(n) = T(n/2) + T(n/4) + T(n/8) + n$$

This doesn't fit master theorem form (unequal subproblems). Using recursion tree:

- Height is $$\lg n$$ (longest path)
- Each level contributes $$\le n$$
- Total: $$T(n) = \Theta(n \lg n)$$

Can verify using Akra-Bazzi method.

### Part (g): $$T(n) = T(n-1) + 1/n$$

Subtractive recurrence. Expanding:

$$T(n) = T(n-1) + 1/n = T(n-2) + 1/(n-1) + 1/n = \cdots = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 1/i = H_n$$

Where $$H_n$$ is the $$n$$-th harmonic number.

**Answer:** $$T(n) = \Theta(\lg n)$$

### Part (h): $$T(n) = T(n-1) + \lg n$$

$$T(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lg i = \lg(n!) = \Theta(n \lg n)$$

### Part (i): $$T(n) = T(n-2) + 1/\lg n$$

$$T(n) = \sum_{i \text{ even}} 1/\lg i \approx \int_2^n \frac{1}{\lg x}dx = \Theta(n/\lg n)$$

### Part (j): $$T(n) = \sqrt{n} T(\sqrt{n}) + n$$

Substitution: Let $$n = 2^m$$, so $$T(2^m) = 2^{m/2}T(2^{m/2}) + 2^m$$

Let $$S(m) = T(2^m)$$: $$S(m) = 2^{m/2}S(m/2) + 2^m$$

This is complex; using Akra-Bazzi or analysis: $$T(n) = \Theta(n \lg \lg n)$$
