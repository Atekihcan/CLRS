> Is the array with values $$\langle 23, 17, 14, 6, 13, 10, 1, 5, 7, 12 \rangle$$ a max-heap?

To determine if this array is a max-heap, we need to check whether the max-heap property holds for every node. Recall that the max-heap property states that for every node $$i$$ other than the root:

$$A[\textsc{Parent}(i)] \ge A[i]$$

Equivalently, we can check that each parent is greater than or equal to both of its children (if they exist). Let's systematically verify this for each internal node.

The array as a binary tree looks like:

![Broken Max-Heap]({{ '/assets/img/06/6.1-6_tree.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }} "Not a max-heap")

Now let's check each internal node:

- **Node 1** (value 23): Children are 17 and 14. Since $$23 \ge 17$$ and $$23 \ge 14$$, this is fine.
- **Node 2** (value 17): Children are 6 and 13. Since $$17 \ge 6$$ and $$17 \ge 13$$, this is fine.
- **Node 3** (value 14): Children are 10 and 1. Since $$14 \ge 10$$ and $$14 \ge 1$$, this is fine.
- **Node 4** (value 6): Children are 5 and 7. We have $$6 \ge 5$$, but $$6 \not\ge 7$$. **Violation!**
- **Node 5** (value 13): Left child is 12. Since $$13 \ge 12$$, this is fine.

So, no, this array is not a max-heap. The max-heap property is violated at node 4, where the parent value (6) is less than its right child (7).
