> Rewrite the $$\textsc {Merge}$$ procedure so that it does not use sentinels, instead stopping once either array $$L$$ or $$R$$ has had all its elements copied back to $$A$$ and then copying the remainder of the other array back into $$A$$.

{% capture code %}
n_1 = q - p + 1
n_2 = r - q
let L[1 .. n_1] and R[1 .. n_2] be new arrays
for i = 1 to n_1
    L[i] = A[p + i - 1]
for j = 1 to n_2
    R[j] = A[q + j]
i = 1
j = 1
for k = p to r
    if i > n1
        A[k] = R[j]
        j = j + 1
    else if j > n2
        A[k] = L[i]
        i = i + 1
    else if L[i] <= R[j]
        A[k] = L[i]
        i = i + 1
    else
        A[k] = R[j]
        j = j + 1
