>Use indicator random variables to compute the expected value of the sum of $$n$$ dice.

This problem asks us to find the expected sum when rolling $$n$$ standard six-sided dice. We'll solve it using indicator random variables to demonstrate the technique, even though this problem can be solved more directly.

### Setting Up Indicator Random Variables

For each die $$i$$ (where $$1 \leq i \leq n$$) and each face value $$j$$ (where $$1 \leq j \leq 6$$), we define an indicator random variable:

$$X_{ij} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if die } i \text{ shows value } j \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

The actual value shown on die $$i$$ can be expressed as:

$$D_i = \sum_{j=1}^{6} j \cdot X_{ij}$$

This works because exactly one of the indicators $$X_{i1}, X_{i2}, \ldots, X_{i6}$$ equals 1 (corresponding to the face that came up), and that indicator gets multiplied by its face value $$j$$.

### Expected Value of One Die

The expected value of die $$i$$ is:

$$\begin{align*}
E[D_i] &= E\left[\sum_{j=1}^{6} j \cdot X_{ij}\right] \\
&= \sum_{j=1}^{6} j \cdot E[X_{ij}] && \text{(Linearity of expectation)} \\
&= \sum_{j=1}^{6} j \cdot \Pr\{X_{ij} = 1\} && \text{(Lemma 5.1)} \\
&= \sum_{j=1}^{6} j \cdot \frac{1}{6} && \text{(Assuming fair die)} \\
&= \frac{1}{6}(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) \\
&= \frac{21}{6} \\
&= 3.5
\end{align*}$$

### Expected Sum of $$n$$ Dice

The total sum of all $$n$$ dice is:

$$S = \sum_{i=1}^{n} D_i$$

By linearity of expectation:

$$\begin{align*}
E[S] &= E\left[\sum_{i=1}^{n} D_i\right] \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^{n} E[D_i] \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^{n} 3.5 \\
&= 3.5n
\end{align*}$$

So, the expected value of the sum of $$n$$ dice is $$\boxed{3.5n}$$ or equivalently $$\boxed{\frac{7n}{2}}$$.

Notice that we never needed to consider the fact that dice rolls are independent. Linearity of expectation works even for dependent random variables! This is what makes indicator random variables such a powerful analytical tool.
