> Show how $$\textsc{OS-Select}(T.root, 10)$$ operates on the red-black tree $$T$$ of Figure 14.1.

We trace through the execution of $$\textsc{OS-Select}(T.root, 10)$$ step by step, showing the value of $$x$$ and $$i$$ at each recursive call.

Think of finding the 10th smallest element as navigating through the tree by asking at each node, "How many elements are smaller than me?" This count (the rank) determines whether we've found our target or need to search left or right.

**Call 1:** $$x$$ is the root (key 26), $$i = 10$$

The rank of node 26 is $$x.left.size + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13$$. Since $$i = 10 < 13$$, the 10th smallest element must be in the left subtree. We recursively call $$\textsc{OS-Select}(x.left, 10)$$.

**Call 2:** $$x$$ has key 17, $$i = 10$$

The rank of node 17 within its subtree is $$x.left.size + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8$$. Since $$i = 10 > 8$$, the 10th smallest element is in the right subtree. Within the right subtree, we're looking for the $$(10 - 8) = 2$$nd smallest element. We call $$\textsc{OS-Select}(x.right, 2)$$.

**Call 3:** $$x$$ has key 21, $$i = 2$$

The rank of node 21 within its subtree is $$x.left.size + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$$. Since $$i = 2 < 3$$, the element we seek is in the left subtree. We call $$\textsc{OS-Select}(x.left, 2)$$.

**Call 4:** $$x$$ has key 19, $$i = 2$$

The rank of node 19 within its subtree is $$x.left.size + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$$. Since $$i = 2 > 1$$, we go right looking for the $$(2 - 1) = 1$$st smallest element. We call $$\textsc{OS-Select}(x.right, 1)$$.

**Call 5:** $$x$$ has key 20, $$i = 1$$

The rank of node 20 within its subtree is $$x.left.size + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$$. Since $$i = r = 1$$, we have found the element! The procedure returns a pointer to the node with key 20.

Therefore, $$\textsc{OS-Select}(T.root, 10)$$ returns the node with key 20, which is indeed the 10th smallest element in the tree.
