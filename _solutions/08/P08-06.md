### A. Number of ways to divide $$2n$$ numbers into two sorted lists

Think about this combinatorially. We have $$2n$$ distinct numbers, and we need to choose which $$n$$ go into the first list (the other $$n$$ automatically go into the second list). Once we've decided which numbers go into each list, their order within each list is determined since each list must be sorted.

The number of ways to choose $$n$$ items from $$2n$$ items is:

$$\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n)!}{n! \cdot n!}$$

Using Stirling's approximation or the fact that $$\binom{2n}{n} \approx \frac{4^n}{\sqrt{\pi n}}$$:

$$\lg \binom{2n}{n} = \Theta(n)$$

More precisely, $$\lg \binom{2n}{n} = 2n - O(\lg n) = 2n - o(n)$$.

### B. Lower bound of $$2n - o(n)$$ using decision tree

Any algorithm that merges two sorted lists must distinguish between all $$\binom{2n}{n}$$ possible ways the elements could be divided into the two lists.

Using the decision tree model:
- The decision tree must have at least $$\binom{2n}{n}$$ leaves
- A binary tree of height $$h$$ has at most $$2^h$$ leaves
- Therefore, $$2^h \geq \binom{2n}{n}$$

Taking logarithms:

$$h \geq \lg \binom{2n}{n} = 2n - o(n)$$

Thus, any algorithm must make at least $$2n - o(n)$$ comparisons in the worst case.

### C. Consecutive elements from different lists must be compared

Let $$x$$ and $$y$$ be two elements that are consecutive in the final sorted order (meaning no element lies between them in value). Suppose $$x$$ comes from list $$A$$ and $$y$$ comes from list $$B$$, with $$x < y$$.

We must prove that any correct merging algorithm must compare $$x$$ and $$y$$.

**Proof by contradiction:** Suppose an algorithm correctly merges the lists without ever comparing $$x$$ and $$y$$.

Since $$x$$ and $$y$$ are never compared, the algorithm's behavior must be the same whether $$x < y$$ or $$y < x$$.

Consider two scenarios:
1. **Original input:** Lists where $$x < y$$ (and they're consecutive)
2. **Modified input:** Swap the values of $$x$$ and $$y$$, so now $$y < x$$ but they're still from different lists

In the modified input, $$y$$ and $$x$$ are still consecutive (no elements between them), but their order is reversed.

Since the algorithm never compares $$x$$ and $$y$$, it follows the same sequence of comparisons for both inputs. Therefore, it produces the same output for both inputs. But the correct output should place $$x$$ before $$y$$ in the original input and $$y$$ before $$x$$ in the modified input. This is a contradiction.

Therefore, $$x$$ and $$y$$ must be compared.

### D. Lower bound of $$2n - 1$$ comparisons

Consider the final merged sorted list of $$2n$$ elements. There are $$2n - 1$$ consecutive pairs of elements.

From part (c), every consecutive pair where elements come from different lists must be compared.

In the worst case, how many consecutive pairs have elements from different lists?

The worst case is when elements from the two lists alternate as much as possible in the final sorted order. For example:
- List A: $$[1, 3, 5, 7]$$
- List B: $$[2, 4, 6, 8]$$
- Merged: $$[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]$$

In this case, $$2n - 1$$ consecutive pairs exist, and at most one pair (if any) consists of two elements from the same list.

Actually, at least $$2n - 2$$ consecutive pairs must have elements from different lists. Here's why: The merged list alternates between lists at most $$2n - 1$$ times (if it starts with one list and alternates perfectly). This means at most 1 consecutive pair can have both elements from the same list.

Wait, let me reconsider. If we have $$n$$ elements from each list, and they alternate perfectly, we get exactly $$2n - 1$$ consecutive pairs, and $$2n - 2$$ of them cross between lists (the only exception is if all elements from one list come before all from the other).

Actually, in the worst case, the minimum number of same-list consecutive pairs is 1 (the last element of one list followed by the first element of the other, if all of one list comes before the other). So the maximum number of cross-list pairs is $$2n - 2$$...

Let me reconsider this more carefully. At minimum, each list contributes to at least one "run" in the output. If both lists each contribute exactly 1 run, then we have 2 runs total, which means 1 boundary between runs. This gives us at most $$2n - 2$$ cross-list comparisons.

But actually, the correct answer is $$2n - 1$$. The insight is that among $$2n - 1$$ consecutive pairs, **at least** $$2n - 1$$ must involve cross-list elements in some inputs. This gives the lower bound of $$2n - 1$$ comparisons.

The precise argument: Consider the worst-case input where elements interleave maximally. All $$2n - 1$$ consecutive pairs in the output involve different lists, so all must be compared, giving $$2n - 1$$ as the lower bound.
