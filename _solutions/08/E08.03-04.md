> Show how to sort $$n$$ integers in the range 0 to $$n^3 - 1$$ in $$O(n)$$ time.

The key is to represent each integer in base $$n$$ and use radix sort.

Think of each number as having multiple "digits" when written in base $$n$$. Since the maximum value is $$n^3 - 1$$, the largest number in base $$n$$ has 3 digits (ranging from 0 to $$n - 1$$ in each position).

For example, if $$n = 10$$, numbers range from 0 to 999, which are naturally 3-digit numbers in base 10.

### Algorithm:

1. Convert each integer to base $$n$$ representation (conceptually; we can extract digits using modulo and division)
2. Use radix sort with $$d = 3$$ digits
3. For the stable sort on each digit, use counting sort with $$k = n - 1$$

### Analysis:

Each integer in range $$[0, n^3 - 1]$$ can be represented as:

$$x = x_2 \cdot n^2 + x_1 \cdot n + x_0$$

where $$0 \leq x_i < n$$ for each digit $$x_i$$.

Using radix sort with $$d = 3$$ digits, each in range $$[0, n - 1]$$:
- We make $$d = 3$$ passes
- Each pass uses counting sort with $$k = n$$, taking $$\Theta(n + k) = \Theta(n + n) = \Theta(n)$$ time
- Total time: $$\Theta(d \cdot n) = \Theta(3n) = \Theta(n)$$

### Example:

For $$n = 10$$ and numbers in $$[0, 999]$$:
- Number 847 becomes $$(8, 4, 7)$$ in base 10
- Number 23 becomes $$(0, 2, 3)$$ in base 10
- Sort first on the ones digit, then tens, then hundreds

The algorithm runs in $$\Theta(n)$$ time, achieving linear-time sorting!

{% capture note %}
More generally, if integers are in range $$[0, n^c - 1]$$ for constant $$c$$, we can sort in $$\Theta(n)$$ time using base $$n$$ and $$d = c$$ digits. The key is that $$d$$ must be constant for the linear time complexity.
