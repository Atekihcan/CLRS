{% capture note %}
An interesting point to note here is that there were two $$41$$s in the array. And the relative order of these two have been maintained (state 4 and 5) in the final sorted array. In other words, the first $$41$$ appearing in the original unsorted array is still still the first $$41$$ in the final sorted array.

This is a notable property for *some* sorting algorithms, like insertion sort in this case. This property is known as [stability](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stability-in-sorting-algorithms/){:target="_blank"}.

This exact array was used in the first chapter to introduce the first algorithm example in this book: ***sorting***. You'll find it in the page 5 of the book.
