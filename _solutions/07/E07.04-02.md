> Show that quicksort's best-case running time is $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$.

To establish a lower bound on quicksort's best-case running time, we'll show that even in the most favorable scenario, the algorithm must perform at least $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$ work.


Quicksort's best case occurs when partitions are as balanced as possible at every level. The most balanced partition splits the array into two nearly equal halves, with subarrays of sizes $$\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$$ and $$\lceil n/2 \rceil - 1$$ (accounting for the pivot element).

For simplicity, assume perfect splits of size $$n/2$$ each. The recurrence for the best case is:

$$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$$


We'll prove that $$T(n) \geq cn \lg n$$ for some constant $$c > 0$$ using the substitution method.

**Hypothesis:** $$T(n) \geq dn \lg n$$ for some constant $$d > 0$$.

**Inductive step:** Assume $$T(k) \geq dk \lg k$$ for all $$k < n$$.

Since $$\Theta(n) \geq cn$$ for some constant $$c > 0$$ (by definition of $$\Theta$$), we have:

$$\begin{align*}
T(n) &= 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n) \\
     &\geq 2d(n/2)\lg(n/2) + cn \\
     &= dn(\lg n - \lg 2) + cn \\
     &= dn \lg n - dn + cn \\
     &= dn \lg n + (c - d)n
\end{align*}$$

For this to be at least $$dn \lg n$$, we need:

$$(c - d)n \geq 0$$

This holds when $$d \leq c$$. Choosing $$d = c$$ gives us $$T(n) \geq cn \lg n$$, proving $$T(n) = \Omega(n \lg n)$$.


Quicksort's best-case performance exactly matches this lower bound. From the master theorem, the recurrence $$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$$ has solution $$T(n) = \Theta(n \lg n)$$.

Combined with the upper bound $$T(n) = O(n \lg n)$$ (which follows from the master theorem), we have:

$$T(n) = \Theta(n \lg n)$$

This proves that quicksort's best-case running time is both $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$ and $$O(n \lg n)$$, making it exactly $$\Theta(n \lg n)$$.

{% capture note %}
This $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$ lower bound represents a fundamental limit for comparison-based sorting in the best case with a divide-and-conquer approach. Quicksort achieves this bound when partitions are balanced, which is why it's asymptotically optimal among comparison-based sorts in its best case.
