> Argue that the indicator random variable $$X_k$$ and the value $$T(\max(k - 1, n - k))$$ are independent.

Recall that $$X_k = \mathbb{I}\{\text{the subarray } A[p \ldots q] \text{ has exactly } k \text{ elements}\}$$ indicates whether the partition creates a low side with exactly $$k$$ elements (including the pivot).

The key to understanding independence is recognizing what each random variable depends on. The indicator $$X_k$$ is determined solely by which element $$\textsc{Randomized-Partition}$$ chooses as the pivot. Since $$\textsc{Randomized-Partition}$$ selects the pivot uniformly at random from the current subarray, each choice that results in exactly $$k$$ elements on the low side has probability $$1/n$$.

The running time $$T(\max(k - 1, n - k))$$ on the recursive call depends on the random choices made within that recursive call, specifically the sequence of pivots chosen in all future recursive calls. These future random choices have not yet been made when we select the current pivot.

Since the random pivot selections in $$\textsc{Randomized-Select}$$ are independent at each level of recursion, the current pivot choice (which determines $$X_k$$) is independent of all future pivot choices (which determine the running time of the recursive call). The randomness that determines whether $$X_k = 1$$ comes from the current call's random pivot selection, while the randomness in $$T(\max(k - 1, n - k))$$ comes entirely from future random pivot selections in the recursive call.

Therefore, $$X_k$$ and $$T(\max(k - 1, n - k))$$ are independent random variables, which allows us to apply equation (C.24) and separate the expectation: $$\mathbb{E}[X_k \cdot T(\max(k-1, n-k))] = \mathbb{E}[X_k] \cdot \mathbb{E}[T(\max(k-1, n-k))]$$.
