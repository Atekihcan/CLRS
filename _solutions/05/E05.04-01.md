> How many people must there be in a room before the probability that someone has the same birthday as you do is at least $$1/2$$? How many people must there be before the probability that at least two people have a birthday on July 4 is greater than $$1/2$$?

This problem differs from the classic birthday paradox because we're now asking about matching a *specific* birthday rather than finding any two people with matching birthdays.

### A

Think of this as repeatedly asking "Does this person share my birthday?" For each person, the probability they have your birthday is $$1/n$$ (where $$n = 365$$), so the probability they do not is $$(n-1)/n$$.

If we have $$k$$ people in the room (besides yourself), the probability that *none* of them share your birthday is:

$$\begin{align*}
\Pr\{\text{no match}\} &= \left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)^k
\end{align*}$$

Therefore, the probability that *at least one* person shares your birthday is:

$$\begin{align*}
\Pr\{\text{at least one match}\} &= 1 - \left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)^k
\end{align*}$$

We want this probability to be at least $$1/2$$:

$$\begin{align*}
1 - \left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)^k &\geq \frac{1}{2} \\
\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)^k &\leq \frac{1}{2} \\
k \ln\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right) &\leq \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \\
k &\geq \frac{\ln(1/2)}{\ln((n-1)/n)} \\
k &\geq \frac{-\ln 2}{\ln(1 - 1/n)}
\end{align*}$$

Using the approximation $$\ln(1-x) \approx -x$$ for small $$x$$:

$$\begin{align*}
k &\geq \frac{-\ln 2}{-1/n} \\
k &\geq n \ln 2 \\
k &\geq 365 \times 0.693 \\
k &\geq 253
\end{align*}$$

For an exact calculation with $$n = 365$$:

$$\begin{align*}
k &\geq \frac{\ln 2}{\ln(365/364)} \\
k &\geq \frac{0.693147}{0.002747} \\
k &\geq 252.5
\end{align*}$$

Therefore, we need **253 people** (besides yourself) in the room.

### B

This is subtly different. Now we are asking: among $$k$$ people, what is the probability that at least two have July 4 as their birthday?

Let $$X$$ be the number of people with July 4 birthday. Then $$X$$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $$k$$ and $$p = 1/365$$.

The exact probability calculation using binomial distribution is:

$$\begin{align*}
\Pr\{X \geq 2\} &= 1 - \Pr\{X = 0\} - \Pr\{X = 1\} \\
&= 1 - \binom{k}{0}\left(\frac{1}{365}\right)^0\left(\frac{364}{365}\right)^k - \binom{k}{1}\left(\frac{1}{365}\right)^1\left(\frac{364}{365}\right)^k \\
&= 1 - \left(\frac{364}{365}\right)^k - k\left(\frac{1}{365}\right)\left(\frac{364}{365}\right)^k \\
&= 1 - \left(\frac{364}{365}\right)^k\left(1 + \frac{k}{365}\right)
\end{align*}$$

We want:

$$1 - \left(\frac{364}{365}\right)^k\left(1 + \frac{k}{365}\right) > \frac{1}{2}$$

This does not have a closed form solution, but we can solve numerically. Testing values:

For $$k = 612$$:
$$\begin{align*}
\Pr\{X \geq 2\} &= 1 - (364/365)^{612}(1 + 612/365) \\
&\approx 1 - 0.169 \times 2.677 \\
&\approx 1 - 0.452 \\
&\approx 0.548 > 0.5
\end{align*}$$

For $$k = 611$$:
$$\Pr\{X \geq 2\} \approx 0.497 < 0.5$$

Therefore, we need **at least 612 people** for the probability to exceed $$1/2$$.

{% capture note %}
1. **Matching your birthday**: Linear in $$n$$ (about $$253$$ people for $$n=365$$). This is because we're comparing against a fixed target.

2. **At least two share July 4**: Also linear in $$n$$ (about $$612$$ people). We need enough people so that the expected number with July 4 birthday is at least 2.

3. **Classic paradox** (any two match): Scales as $$\sqrt{n}$$ (only $$23$$ people for $$n=365$$). This is because we're comparing all pairs.
