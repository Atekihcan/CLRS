>Why didnâ€™t we use the integral approximation (A.12) directly on $$\sum_{k = 1}^n 1/k$$ to obtain an upper bound on the $$n$$-th harmonic number?.

To get an upper bound using integral approximation (A.12), we need to integrate the function from $$x = (1 - 1) = 0$$. This makes the function $$\frac 1 x$$ undefined because of division-by-zero. To avoid this, we took out the first term ($$k = 1$$) and carried out the sum from $$k = 2$$ and the integral from $$x = 1$$.
